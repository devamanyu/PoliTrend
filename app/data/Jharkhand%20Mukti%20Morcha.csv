Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) ; translation: Jharkhand Liberation Front) is a state political party in the Indian state of Jharkhand. It has two seats in the 15th Lok Sabha. Shibu Soren is the president of the JMM. JMM is also an influential political party in the neighbouring Indian states of Odisha and West Bengal.
The party was officially created on the birthday of Birsa Munda, the 19th century tribal warrior of Jharkhand, who fought against the British rule in present-day Jharkhand.[2] The State of Jharkhand also came into existence on Birsa Munda's birthday in 2000.[3]
100% of their MP's who contested in 2009 elections were candidates with pending criminal cases in their name.[4][5][better source needed]


For almost six decades the movement for formation of Jharkhand from Bihar had been changing colour and strategy to gain a foothold. The Jharkhand Party grew politically stronger but the commissions examining the demands for a separate Jharkhand State rejected these demands every time. Despite the reports of these commissions deciding against them, the Jharkhand Party never lost sight of its ultimate target: a separate state of Jharkhand. Till 1962 Jharkhand Party won between 23-32 seats in the Bihar Legislative Assembly. Post 1962 the Jharkhand Party aligned with Indin National Congress and Jaipal Singh became a minister in Vinodanand Jha's government in Bihar. With this, the demand for the Tribal Homeland was put on hold for nearly a decade.
At the 4th General Election held in 1967 the party had a very poor showing with only eight Assembly seats. The party soon split into several splinter groups each claiming to be the genuine Jharkhand Party. These were - the Jharkhand Party led by N.E. Horo, the Jharkhand Party led by Naren, All India Jharkhand Party led by Bagun Sumroi, the Hul Jharkhand Party led by Justin Richard which further fragmented and came to be called the Bihar Progressive Hul Jharkhand Party and it was led by Shibu Soren.
Santhal leader Shri Shibu Soren founded the ‘Sonat Santhali Samaj’ in 1969. The movement was infused with a new radicalism when Shibu Soren formed the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) in league with the Marxist co-ordination Committee in 1972 with the help of Shri Binod Bihari Mahto, the leader of ‘Shivajee Samaj’. The party was officially created on the birthday of Birsa Munda, the 19th century tribal warrior of Jharkhand, who fought against the British rule in present-day Jharkhand.[6]
On 4th Feb, 1973 Shri Binod Bihari Mahto became president and Shri Shibu Soren as General Secretary of the party. The prominent party leaders at that time were: Comrade A. K. Roy (Party Secretary-Society of Industrial and Coal Laborers), late Martin Nirmal Mahto (prominent Trade Union Movement leader), late Tek Lal Mahto among others.
In its early years, the JMM under Soren's leadership brought industrial and mining workers who were mainly non-tribals belonging to the Dalit and Backward communities such as Surdis, Doms, Dusadh and Kurmi-Mahtos into its fold. However Soren's association with the late congress M.P. Gyanranjan brought him close to the then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi in New Delhi. He won the Dumka Lok Sabha seat in 1972. Irked by Soren's association with the Indian National Congress, a few of the younger members of the JMM banded together in Jamshedpur and set up the All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU). This did not affect the growth of the JMM in the Indian general election, 1991 where the JMM won six seats.
Ram Dayal Munda reignited the movement for Jharkhand by unifying splinter groups among the tribals. Under his guidance the Jharkhand Coordination Committee was constituted in June 1987, comprising 48 organisations and group including the JMM factions. Due to Ram Dayal Munda, Shibu Soren, Suraj Mandal, Simon Marandi, Shailendra Mahato, and AJSU leaders like Surya Singh Besra and Prabhakar Tirkey briefly shared a political platform, but the JMM pulled out of JCC as it felt that 'the collective leadership was a farce'. The JMM/AJSU and JPP successfully orchestrated so-called bandhs, economic blockades in 1988–89. In the interim,
Jharkhand state was formed on 15 November 2000 after almost half a century of people's movements to evolve a Jharkhandi identity, which disadvantaged societal groups articulated to augment political resources and influence the policy process in their favour. It is the 28th state of India.
At the 2005 Jharkhand state assembly elections, the JMM took second place and received 17 of the 81 seats. It supports the government of Independent Chief Minister Madhu Koda which was formed in 2006. It continues to be an active part of the United Progressive Alliance. It has had its fair share of controvoersies when its MPs were involved in the bribery scam during the Rao Government and a scandal in early 2005 about the Chief Minister of Jharkhand. Recently, one of its MPs was assassinated by Naxalites.
After the loss to Bangladesh in the 2007 Cricket World Cup, the house that Mahendra Singh Dhoni was constructing in his home-town Ranchi was vandalized and damaged by political activists of the JMM[7]
Currently, the Bharatiya Janata Party has formed the government in Jharkhand. Raghubar Das is the Chief Minister of Jharkhand. Shibu Soren is the party President of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and is the MP from Dumka Lok Sabha seat and Vijay Kumar Hansdak is another MP of JMM who is elected in Lok Sabha from Rajmahal Lok Sabha seat . C.P.Singh is the Speaker of Jharkhand Vidhan Sabha and a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party Party.
Jharkhand Chhatra Yuva Morcha (Jharkhand Student Youth Front), the youth and student wing of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, was constituted at a conference in Ranchi October 16, 1991. JCYM was formed to counter the influence of the more radical All Jharkhand Students Union.
JMM performed poorly and won just two out of 14 seats in Jharkhand in the Indian general election, 2014. BJP won the rest. JMM won the Dumka Lok Sabha seat and Rajmahal Lok Sabha seat constituencies.[8][9]

The movement was infused with a new radicalism when Shibu Soren formed the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) in league with the Marxist co-ordination Committee in 1972 with the help of Shri Binod Bihari Mahto, the leader of ‘Shivajee Samaj’. The party was officially created on the birthday of Birsa Munda, the 19th century tribal warrior of Jharkhand, who fought against the British rule in present-day Jharkhand.[6]
On 4th Feb, 1973 Shri Binod Bihari Mahto became president and Shri Shibu Soren as General Secretary of the party. The prominent party leaders at that time were: Comrade A. K. Roy (Party Secretary-Society of Industrial and Coal Laborers), late Martin Nirmal Mahto (prominent Trade Union Movement leader), late Tek Lal Mahto among others.
In its early years, the JMM under Soren's leadership brought industrial and mining workers who were mainly non-tribals belonging to the Dalit and Backward communities such as Surdis, Doms, Dusadh and Kurmi-Mahtos into its fold. However Soren's association with the late congress M.P. Gyanranjan brought him close to the then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi in New Delhi. He won the Dumka Lok Sabha seat in 1972. Irked by Soren's association with the Indian National Congress, a few of the younger members of the JMM banded together in Jamshedpur and set up the All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU). This did not affect the growth of the JMM in the Indian general election, 1991 where the JMM won six seats.
Ram Dayal Munda reignited the movement for Jharkhand by unifying splinter groups among the tribals. Under his guidance the Jharkhand Coordination Committee was constituted in June 1987, comprising 48 organisations and group including the JMM factions. Due to Ram Dayal Munda, Shibu Soren, Suraj Manda, Simon Marandi, Shailendra Mahato, and AJSU leaders like Surya Singh Besra and Prabhakar Tirkey briefly shared a political platform, but the JMM pulled out of JCC as it felt that 'the collective leadership was a farce'. The JMM/AJSU and JPP successfully orchestrated so-called bandhs, economic blockades in 1988–89. In the interim,
Jharkhand state was formed on 15 November 2000 after almost half a century of people's movements to evolve a Jharkhandi identity, which disadvantaged societal groups articulated to augment political resources and influence the policy process in their favour. It is the 28th state of India.
At the 2005 Jharkhand state assembly elections, the JMM took second place and received 17 of the 81 seats. It supports the government of Independent Chief Minister Madhu Koda which was formed in 2006. It continues to be an active part of the United Progressive Alliance. It has had its fair share of controvoersies when its MPs were involved in the bribery scam during the Rao Government and a scandal in early 2005 about the Chief Minister of Jharkhand. Recently, one of its MPs was assassinated by Naxalites.

Jharkhand Chhatra Yuva Morcha (Jharkhand Student Youth Front), the youth and student wing of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, was constituted at a conference in Ranchi October 16, 1991. JCYM was formed to counter the influence of the more radical All Jharkhand Students Union.
JMM performed poorly and won just two out of 14 seats in Jharkhand in the Indian general election, 2014. BJP won the rest. JMM won the Dumka Lok Sabha seat and Rajmahal Lok Sabha seat constituencies.[8][9]

Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) ; translation: Jharkhand Liberation Front) is a state political party in the Indian state of Jharkhand. It has two seats in the 15th Lok Sabha.

For almost six decades the movement for formation of Jharkhand from Bihar had been changing colour and strategy to gain a foothold. The Jharkhand Party grew politically stronger but the commissions examining the demands for a separate Jharkhand State rejected these demands every time. Despite the reports of these commissions deciding against them, the Jharkhand Party never lost sight of its ultimate target: a separate state of Jharkhand. Till 1962 Jharkhand Party won between 23-32 seats in the Bihar Legislative Assembly. Post 1962 the Jharkhand Party aligned with Indin National Congress and Jaipal Singh became a minister in Vinodanand Jha's government in Bihar. With this, the demand for the Tribal Homeland was put on hold for nearly a decade.
At the 4th General Election held in 1967 the party had a very poor showing with only eight Assembly seats. The party soon split into several splinter groups each claiming to be the genuine Jharkhand Party. These were - the Jharkhand Party led by N.E.

Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) ; translation: Jharkhand Liberation Front) is a state political party in the Indian state of Jharkhand. It has two seats in the 15th Lok Sabha. Shibu Soren is the president of the JMM. JMM is also an influential political party in the neighbouring Indian states of Odisha and West Bengal.
The party was officially created on the birthday of Birsa Munda, the 19th century tribal warrior of Jharkhand, who fought against the British rule in present-day Jharkhand.[2] The State of Jharkhand also came into existence on Birsa Munda's birthday in 2000.[3]
100% of their MP's who contested in 2009 elections were candidates with pending criminal cases in their name.[4][5][better source needed]


Shri Sibu Soren founded the ‘Sonat Santhali Samaj’ in 1969. On 4th Feb, 1973 with the help of Shri Binod Bihari Mahto, the leader of ‘Shivajee Samaj’, he founded Jharkhand Mukti Morcha. Shri Binod Bihari Mahto became president and Shri Sibu Soren as General Secretary of the party.The prominent party leader at that time our Comrade A.K.Roy party secretary-society of industrial and coal labors., prominent trade union and movement leader late martin Nirmal Mahto, late tek lal mahto among other. For almost six decades the movement for formation of Jharkhand from Bihar had been changing colour and strategy to gain a foothold. The Jharkhand Party grew politically stronger but the commissions examining the demands for a separate Jharkhand State rejected these demands every time. Despite the reports of these commissions deciding against them, the Jharkhand Party never lost sight of its ultimate target: a separate state of Jharkhand. Till 1962 Jharkhand Party won between 23-32 seats in the Bihar Legislative Assembly. Post 1962 the Jharkhand Party aligned with Indin National Congress and Jaipal Singh became a minister in Vinodanand Jha's government in Bihar. With this, the demand for the Tribal Homeland was put on hold for nearly a decade.
At the 4th General Election held in 1967 the party had a very poor showing with only eight Assembly seats. The party soon split into several splinter groups each claiming to be the genuine Jharkhand Party. These were the All India Jharkhand Party led by Bagun Sumroi, the Jharkhand Party led by N.E. Horo, the Hul Jharkhand Party led by Justin Richard which further fragmented and came to be called the Bihar Progressive Hul Jharkhand Party and it was led by Shibu Soren.
The movement was infused with a new radicalism when Santhal leader Shibu Soren formed the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) in league with the Marxist co-ordination Committee in 1972. The party was officially created on the birthday of Birsa Munda, the 19th century tribal warrior of Jharkhand, who fought against the British rule in present-day Jharkhand.[6]
In its early years, the JMM under Soren's leadership brought industrial and mining workers who were mainly non-tribals belonging to the Dalit and Backward communities such as Surdis, Doms, Dusadh and Kurmi-Mahtos into its fold. However Soren's association with the late congress M.P. Gyanranjan brought him close to the then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi in New Delhi. He won the Dumka Lok Sabha seat in 1972. Irked by Soren's association with the Indian National Congress, a few of the younger members of the JMM banded together in Jamshedpur and set up the All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU). This did not affect the growth of the JMM in the Indian general election, 1991 where the JMM won six seats.
Ram Dayal Munda reignited the movement for Jharkahnd by unifying splinter groups among the tribals. Under his guidance the Jharkahnd Coordination Committee was constituted in June 1987, comprising 48 organisations and group including the JMM factions.

Shibu Soren is the president of the JMM. JMM is also an influential political party in the neighbouring Indian states of Odisha and West Bengal.
The party was officially created on the birthday of Birsa Munda, the 19th century tribal warrior of Jharkhand, who fought against the British rule in present-day Jharkhand.[2] The State of Jharkhand also came into existence on Birsa Munda's birthday in 2000.[3]
100% of their MP's who contested in 2009 elections were candidates with pending criminal cases in their name.[4][5][better source needed]


Shri Sibu Soren founded the ‘Sonat Santhali Samaj’ in 1969. On 4th Feb, 1973 with the help of Shri Binod Bihari Mahto, the leader of ‘Shivajee Samaj’, he founded Jharkhand Mukti Morcha. Shri Binod Bihari Mahto became president and Shri Sibu Soren as General Secretary of the party.The prominent party leader at that time our Comrade A.K.Roy party secretary-society of industrial and coal labors., prominent trade union and movement leader late martin Nirmal Mahto, late tek lal mahto among other. For almost six decades the movement for formation of Jharkhand from Bihar had been changing colour and strategy to gain a foothold. The Jharkhand Party grew politically stronger but the commissions examining the demands for a separate Jharkhand State rejected these demands every time. Despite the reports of these commissions deciding against them, the Jharkhand Party never lost sight of its ultimate target: a separate state of Jharkhand. Till 1962 Jharkhand Party won between 23-32 seats in the Bihar Legislative Assembly. Post 1962 the Jharkhand Party aligned with Indin National Congress and Jaipal Singh became a minister in Vinodanand Jha's government in Bihar. With this, the demand for the Tribal Homeland was put on hold for nearly a decade.
At the 4th General Election held in 1967 the party had a very poor showing with only eight Assembly seats. The party soon split into several splinter groups each claiming to be the genuine Jharkhand Party. These were the All India Jharkhand Party led by Bagun Sumroi, the Jharkhand Party led by N.E. Horo, the Hul Jharkhand Party led by Justin Richard which further fragmented and came to be called the Bihar Progressive Hul Jharkhand Party and it was led by Shibu Soren.
The movement was infused with a new radicalism when Santhal leader Shibu Soren formed the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) in league with the Marxist co-ordination Committee in 1972. The party was officially created on the birthday of Birsa Munda, the 19th century tribal warrior of Jharkhand, who fought against the British rule in present-day Jharkhand.[6]
In its early years, the JMM under Soren's leadership brought industrial and mining workers who were mainly non-tribals belonging to the Dalit and Backward communities such as Surdis, Doms, Dusadh and Kurmi-Mahtos into its fold. However Soren's association with the late congress M.P. Gyanranjan brought him close to the then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi in New Delhi. He won the Dumka Lok Sabha seat in 1972. Irked by Soren's association with the Indian National Congress, a few of the younger members of the JMM banded together in Jamshedpur and set up the All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU). This did not affect the growth of the JMM in the Indian general election, 1991 where the JMM won six seats.
Ram Dayal Munda reignited the movement for Jharkahnd by unifying splinter groups among the tribals. Under his guidance the Jharkahnd Coordination Committee was constituted in June 1987, comprising 48 organisations and group including the JMM factions. Due to Munda, Soren[disambiguation needed], Mandal and AJSU leaders like Surya Singh Besra and Prabhakar Tirkey briefly shared a political platform, but the JMM pulled out of JCC as it felt that 'the collective leadership was a farce'. The JMM/AJSU and JPP successfully orchestrated so-called bandhs, economic blockades in 1988–89. In the interim,
Jharkhand state was formed on 15 November 2000 after almost half a century of people's movements to evolve a Jharkhandi identity, which disadvantaged societal groups articulated to augment political resources and influence the policy process in their favour. It is the 28th state of India.
At the 2005 Jharkhand state assembly elections, the JMM took second place and received 17 of the 81 seats. It supports the government of Independent Chief Minister Madhu Koda which was formed in 2006. It continues to be an active part of the United Progressive Alliance. It has had its fair share of controvoersies when its MPs were involved in the bribery scam during the Rao Government and a scandal in early 2005 about the Chief Minister of Jharkhand. Recently, one of its MPs was assassinated by Naxalites.
After the loss to Bangladesh in the 2007 Cricket World Cup, the house that Mahendra Singh Dhoni was constructing in his home-town Ranchi was vandalized and damaged by political activists of the JMM[7]
Currently, the Bharatiya Janata Party has formed the government in Jharkhand. Raghubar Das is the Chief Minister of Jharkhand. Shibu Soren is the party President of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and is the MP from Dumka Lok Sabha seat and Vijay Kumar Hansdak is another MP of JMM who is elected in Lok Sabha from Rajmahal Lok Sabha seat . C.P.Singh is the Speaker of Jharkhand Vidhan Sabha and a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party Party.
Jharkhand Chhatra Yuva Morcha (Jharkhand Student Youth Front), the youth and student wing of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, was constituted at a conference in Ranchi October 16, 1991. JCYM was formed to counter the influence of the more radical All Jharkhand Students Union.
JMM performed poorly and won just two out of 14 seats in Jharkhand in the Indian general election, 2014. BJP won the rest. JMM won the Dumka Lok Sabha seat and Rajmahal Lok Sabha seat constituencies.[8][9]

However Soren's association with the late congress M.P. Gyanranjan brought him close to the then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi in New Delhi. He won the Dumka Lok Sabha seat in 1972. Irked by Soren's association with the Indian National Congress, a few of the younger members of the JMM banded together in Jamshedpur and set up the All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU). This did not affect the growth of the JMM in the Indian general election, 1991 where the JMM won six seats.
Ram Dayal Munda reignited the movement for Jharkahnd by unifying splinter groups among the tribals. Under his guidance the Jharkahnd Coordination Committee was constituted in June 1987, comprising 48 organisations and group including the JMM factions. Due to Munda, Soren[disambiguation needed], Mandal and AJSU leaders like Surya Singh Besra and Prabhakar Tirkey briefly shared a political platform, but the JMM pulled out of JCC as it felt that 'the collective leadership was a farce'. The JMM/AJSU and JPP successfully orchestrated so-called bandhs, economic blockades in 1988–89. In the interim,
Jharkhand state was formed on 15 November 2000 after almost half a century of people's movements to evolve a Jharkhandi identity, which disadvantaged societal groups articulated to augment political resources and influence the policy process in their favour. It is the 28th state of India.
At the 2005 Jharkhand state assembly elections, the JMM took second place and received 17 of the 81 seats. It supports the government of Independent Chief Minister Madhu Koda which was formed in 2006. It continues to be an active part of the United Progressive Alliance. It has had its fair share of controvoersies when its MPs were involved in the bribery scam during the Rao Government and a scandal in early 2005 about the Chief Minister of Jharkhand. Recently, one of its MPs was assassinated by Naxalites.

Currently, the Bharatiya Janata Party has formed the government in Jharkhand. Raghubir Das is the Chief Minister of Jharkhand.

C.P.Singh is the Speaker of Jharkhand Vidhan Sabha and a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party Party.
Jharkhand Chhatra Yuva Morcha (Jharkhand Student Youth Front), the youth and student wing of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, was constituted at a conference in Ranchi October 16, 1991. JCYM was formed to counter the influence of the more radical All Jharkhand Students Union.
JMM performed poorly and won just two out of 14 seats in Jharkhand in the Indian general election, 2014. BJP won the rest. JMM won the Dumka Lok Sabha seat and Rajmahal Lok Sabha seat constituencies.[8][9]

Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) ; translation: Jharkhand Liberation Front) is a state political party in the Indian state of Jharkhand. It has two seats in the 15th Lok Sabha. Shibu Soren is the president of the JMM. JMM is also an influential political party in the neighbouring Indian states of Odisha and West Bengal.
The party was officially created on the birthday of Birsa Munda, the 19th century tribal warrior of Jharkhand, who fought against the British rule in present-day Jharkhand.[2] The State of Jharkhand also came into existence on Birsa Munda's birthday in 2000.[3]
100% of their MP's who contested in 2009 elections were candidates with pending criminal cases in their name.[4][5][better source needed]


For almost six decades the movement for formation of Jharkhand from Bihar had been changing colour and strategy to gain a foothold. The Jharkhand Party grew politically stronger but the commissions examining the demands for a separate Jharkhand State rejected these demands every time. Despite the reports of these commissions deciding against them, the Jharkhand Party never lost sight of its ultimate target: a separate state of Jharkhand. Till 1962 Jharkhand Party won between 23-32 seats in the Bihar Legislative Assembly. Post 1962 the Jharkhand Party aligned with Indin National Congress and Jaipal Singh became a minister in Vinodanand Jha's government in Bihar. With this, the demand for the Tribal Homeland was put on hold for nearly a decade.
At the 4th General Election held in 1967 the party had a very poor showing with only eight Assembly seats. The party soon split into several splinter groups each claiming to be the genuine Jharkhand Party. These were the All India Jharkhand Party led by Bagun Sumroi, the Jharkhand Party led by N.E. Horo, the Hul Jharkhand Party led by Justin Richard which further fragmented and came to be called the Bihar Progressive Hul Jharkhand Party and it was led by Shibu Soren.
The movement was infused with a new radicalism when Santhal leader Shibu Soren formed the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) in league with the Marxist co-ordination Committee in 1972.

In its early years, the JMM under Soren's leadership brought industrial and mining workers who were mainly non-tribals belonging to the Dalit and Backward communities such as Surdis, Doms, Dusadh and Kurmi-Mahtos into its fold. However Soren's association with the late congress M.P. Gyanranjan brought him close to the then prime minister of India, Indira Gandhi in New Delhi. He won the Dumka Lok Sabha seat in 1972. Irked by Soren's association with the Congress, a few of the younger members of the JMM banded together in Jamshedpur and set up the All Jharkhand Students' Union (AJSU). This did not affect the growth of the JMM in the 1991 Lok Sabha election where the JMM won six seats.
Ram Dayal Munda reignited the movement for Jharkahnd by unifying splinter groups among the tribals. Under his guidance the Jharkahnd Coordination Committee was constituted in June 1987, comprising 48 organisations and group including the JMM factions. Due to Munda, Soren, Mandal and AJSU leaders like Surya Singh Besra and Prabhakar Tirkey briefly shared a political platform, but the JMM pulled out of JCC as it felt that 'the collective leadership was a farce'. The JMM/AJSU and JPP successfully orchestrated so-called bandhs, economic blockades in 1988–89. In the interim,
Jharkhand state was formed on 15 November 2000 after almost half a century of people's movements to evolve a Jharkhandi identity, which disadvantaged societal groups articulated to augment political resources and influence the policy process in their favour. It is the 28th state of India.
At the 2005 Jharkhand state assembly elections, the JMM took second place and received 17 of the 81 seats. It supports the government of Independent Chief Minister Madhu Koda which was formed in 2006. It continues to be an active part of the United Progressive Alliance. It has had its fair share of controvoersies when its MPs were involved in the bribery scam during the Rao Government and a scandal in early 2005 about the Chief Minister of Jharkhand. Recently, one of its MPs was assassinated by Naxalites. After the loss to Bangladesh in the 2007 Cricket World Cup, the house that Dhoni was constructing in his home-town Ranchi was vandalized and damaged by political activists of the JMM[7]
Currently, the Bharatiya Janata Party has formed the government in Jharkhand. Raghubir Das is the Chief Minister of Jharkhand. Shri Shibu Soren is the party President of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and is the MP from Dumka. C.P.Singh is the Speaker of Jharkhand Vidhan Sabha and a member of the BJP Party.
Jharkhand Chhatra Yuva Morcha (Jharkhand Student Youth Front), the youth and student wing of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, was constituted at a conference in Ranchi October 16, 1991. JCYM was formed to counter the influence of the more radical All Jharkhand Students Union.
JMM performed poorly and won just two out of 14 seats in Jharkhand in the Indian general election, 2014. BJP won the rest. JMM won the Dumka and Rajmahal constituencies.[8][9]

Shibu Soren is the president of the JMM. JMM is also an influential political party in the neighbouring indian states of Odisha and West Bengal.
The party was officially created on the birthday of Birsa Munda, the 19th century tribal warrior of Jharkhand, who fought against the British rule in present-day Jharkhand.[2] The State of Jharkhand also came into existence on Birsa Munda's birthday in 2000.[3]
100% of their MP's who contested in 2009 elections were candidates with pending criminal cases in their name.[4][5][better source needed]


For almost six decades the movement for formation of Jharkhand from Bihar had been changing colour and strategy to gain a foothold. The Jharkhand Party grew politically stronger but the commissions examining the demands for a separate Jharkhand State rejected these demands every time. Despite the reports of these commissions deciding against them, the Jharkhand Party never lost sight of its ultimate target: a separate state of Jharkhand. Till 1962 Jharkhand Party won between 23-32 seats in the Bihar Assembly. Post 1962 the Jharkhand Party aligned with Congress and Jaipal Singh became a minister in Vinodanand Jha's government in Bihar. With this, the demand for the Tribal Homeland was put on hold for nearly a decade.
At the 4th General Election held in 1967 the party had a very poor showing with only eight Assembly seats. The party soon split into several splinter groups each claiming to be the genuine Jharkhand party. These were the All India Jharkhand Party led by Bagun Sumroi, the Jharkhand Party led by N.E. Horo, the Hul Jharkhand Party led by Justin Richard which further fragmented and came to be called the Bihar Progressive Hul Jharkhand Party and it was led by Shibu Soren.

At the 2005 Jharkhand state assembly elections, the JMM took second place and received 17 of the 81 seats. It supports the government of Independent Chief Minister Madhu Koda which was formed in 2006. It continues to be an active part of the United Progressive Alliance. It has had its fair share of controvoersies when its MPs were involved in the bribery scam during the Rao Government and a scandal in early 2005 about the Chief Minister of Jharkhand.

Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) ; translation: Jharkhand Liberation Front) is a state political party in the Indian state of Jharkhand. It has two seats in the 15th Lok Sabha. Shibu Soren is the president of the JMM. JMM is also an influential political party in the neighbouring indian states of Odisha and West Bengal.
The party was officially created on the birthday of Birsa Munda, the 19th century tribal warrior of Jharkhand, who fought against the British rule in present-day Jharkhand.[2] The State of Jharkhand also came into existence on Birsa Munda's birthday in 2000.[3]
100% of their MP's who contested in 2009 elections were candidates with pending criminal cases in their name. [4][5]


For almost six decades the movement for formation of Jharkhand from Bihar had been changing colour and strategy to gain a foothold. The Jharkhand Party grew politically stronger but the commissions examining the demands for a separate Jharkhand State rejected these demands every time. Despite the reports of these commissions deciding against them, the Jharkhand Party never lost sight of its ultimate target: a separate state of Jharkhand. Till 1962 Jharkhand Party won between 23-32 seats in the Bihar Assembly. Post 1962 the Jharkhand Party aligned with Congress and Jaipal Singh became a minister in Vinodanand Jha's government in Bihar. With this, the demand for the Tribal Homeland was put on hold for nearly a decade.
At the 4th General Election held in 1967 the party had a very poor showing with only eight Assembly seats. The party soon split into several splinter groups each claiming to be the genuine Jharkhand party. These were the All India Jharkhand Party led by Bagun Sumroi, the Jharkhand Party led by N.E. Horo, the Hul Jharkhand Party led by Justin Richard which further fragmented and came to be called the Bihar Progressive Hul Jharkhand Party and it was led by Shibu Soren.
The movement was infused with a new radicalism when Santhal leader Shibu Soren formed the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) in league with the Marxist co-ordination Committee in 1972. The party was officially created on the birthday of Birsa Munda, the 19th century tribal warrior of Jharkhand, who fought against the British rule in present-day Jharkhand.[6]
In its early years, the JMM under Soren's leadership brought industrial and mining workers who were mainly non-tribals belonging to the Dalit and Backward communities such as Surdis, Doms, Dusadh and Kurmi-Mahtos into its fold. However Soren's association with the late congress M.P. Gyanranjan brought him close to the then prime minister of India, Indira Gandhi in New Delhi. He won the Dumka Lok Sabha seat in 1972. Irked by Soren's association with the Congress, a few of the younger members of the JMM banded together in Jamshedpur and set up the All Jharkhand Students' Union (AJSU). This did not affect the growth of the JMM in the 1991 Lok Sabha election where the JMM won six seats.

It has a strength of 2 in the 15th Lok Sabha. Shibu Soren is the president of JMM. JMM is also an influential political party in neighbouring states of Orissa, West Bengal.
The party was officially created on the birthday of Birsa Munda, the 19th century tribal warrior of Jharkhand, who fought against the British rule in present-day Jharkhand.[2] The State of Jharkhand also came into existence on Birsa Munda's birthday in 2000.[3]
100% of their MP's who contested in 2009 elections were candidates with pending criminal cases in their name. [4][5]


For almost six decades the movement for formation of Jharkhand from bihar had been changing colour and strategy to gain a foothold. The Jharkhand Party grew politically stronger but the commissions examining the demands for a separate Jharkhand State rejected it one after another.Despite these reports of these commissions going negative in nature, Jharkhand Party never lost sight of its ultimate target: a separate state of Jharkhand. Till 1962 Jharkhand Party won between 23-32 seats in the Bihar Assembly. Post 1962 the Jharkhand Party aligned with Congress and Jaipal Singh became a minister in Vinodanand Jha's government in Bihar. With this, the demand for the Tribal Homeland was put into cold storage for nearly a decade.
In the 4th General Election held in 1967 the party had a very poor show with only eight Assembly seats. The party was soon split into several splinter groups each claiming to be the genuine Jharkhand party. These were the All India Jharkhand Party led by Bagun Sumroi, the Jharkhand Party led by N.E. Horo, the Hul Jharkhand Party led by Justin Richard which got further fragmented and came to be called the Bihar Progressive Hul Jharkhand Party and it was led by Shibu Soren.
The movement was infused with a new radicalism when Santhal leader Shibu Soren formed the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) in league with the Marxist co-ordination Committee in 1972. The party was officially created on the birthday of Birsa Munda, the 19th century tribal warrior of Jharkhand, who fought against the British rule in present-day Jharkhand.[6]
In its early years, the JMM under Soren's leadership, brought industrial and mining workers mainly non-tribals belonging to Dalit and Backward communities such as Surdis, Doms, Dusadh and Kurmi-Mahtos, into its fold. However Soren's association with the late congress M.P. Gyanranjan brought him close to then prime minister of India, Indira Gandhi, in New Delhi. He won the Dumka Lok Sabha seat in 1972. Irked by Soren's association with the Congress, a few of the younger members of the JMM banded together in Jamshedpur and set up the All Jharkhand Students' Union (AJSU). This did nothing to stunt the growth of the JMM in the 1991 Lok Sabha election where the JMM won six seats.
Ram Dayal Munda reignited the movement for Jharkahnd by unifying splinter groups among the tribals. Under his guidance the Jharkahnd Coordination Committee was constituted in June 1987, comprising 48 organisations and group including the JMM factions. Due to Munda, Soren, Mandal and AJSU leaders like Surya Singh Besra and Prabhakar Tirkey briefly shared a political platform. But the JMM pulled out of JCC as it felt that 'the collective leadership was a farce'. The JMM/AJSU and JPP successfully orchestrated bandhs, economic blockades in 1988–89. In the interim,

Jharkhand state was formed on 15 November 2000 after almost half a century of people's movements to evolve a Jharkhandi identity, which disadvantaged societal groups articulated to augment political resources and influence the policy process in their favour. It is the 28th state of India.
At the 2005 Jharkhand state assembly elections, the JMM took second place and received 17 of the 81 seats. It supports the government of Independent Chief Minister Madhu Koda which was formed in 2006. It continues to be an active part of the United Progressive Alliance. It has had its fair share of controvoersies when its MPs were involved in the bribery scam during the Rao Government and a scandal in early 2005 about the Chief Minister of Jharkhand. Recently, one of its MPs was assassinated by Naxalites. After the loss to Bangladesh in the 2007 Cricket World Cup, the house that Dhoni was constructing in his home-town Ranchi was vandalized and damaged by political activists of the JMM[7]
Currently, the Bharatiya Janata Party has formed the government in Jharkhand. Raghubir Das is the Chief Minister of Jharkhand. Wasim Akram Khan is the party President of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and is the MP from Dumka. C.P.Singh is the Speaker of Jharkhand Vidhan Sabha and a member of the BJP Party.
JMM performed poorly and won just two out of 14 seats in Jharkhand in the Indian general election, 2014. BJP won the rest. JMM won the Dumka and Rajmahal constituencies.[8][9]

However Soren's association with the late congress M.P. Gyanranjan brought him close to then prime minister of India, Indira Gandhi, in New Delhi. He won the Dumka Lok Sabha seat in 1972. Irked by Soren's association with the Congress, a few of the younger members of the JMM banded together in Jamshedpur and set up the All Jharkhand Students' Union (AJSU). This did nothing to stunt the growth of the JMM in the 1991 Lok Sabha election where the JMM won six seats.
Ram Dayal Munda reignited the movement for Jharkahnd by unifying splinter groups among the tribals. Under his guidance the Jharkahnd Coordination Committee was constituted in June 1987, comprising 48 organisations and group including the JMM factions. Due to Munda, Soren, Mandal and AJSU leaders like Surya Singh Besra and Prabhakar Tirkey briefly shared a political platform. But the JMM pulled out of JCC as it felt that 'the collective leadership was a farce'. The JMM/AJSU and JPP successfully orchestrated bandhs, economic blockades in 1988–89. In the interim,

Jharkhand state was formed on 15 November 2000 after almost half a century of people's movements to evolve a Jharkhandi identity, which disadvantaged societal groups articulated to augment political resources and influence the policy process in their favour. It is the 28th state of India.
At the 2005 Jharkhand state assembly elections, the JMM took second place and received 17 of the 81 seats. It supports the government of Independent Chief Minister Madhu Koda which was formed in 2006. It continues to be an active part of the United Progressive Alliance. It has had its fair share of controvoersies when its MPs were involved in the bribery scam during the Rao Government and the fiasco in early 2005 about the Chief Minister of Jharkhand. Recently, one of its MPs was assassinated by Naxalites. After the loss to Bangladesh in 2007 Cricket World Cup, the house that Dhoni was constructing in his home-town Ranchi was vandalized and damaged by political activists of JMM[7]
Currently, it has left the alliance with Bharatiya Janata Party to form the government in Jharkhand. Presently. Hemant Soren is the CM of Jharkhand. Wasim Akram Khan is the party President of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and is MP from Dumka. C.P.Singh is the Speaker of Jharkhand Vidhan Sabha from BJP Party.
JMM performed poorly and won just two seats out of 14 seats in Jharkhand in Indian general election, 2014. BJP won the rest. JMM won Dumka and Rajmahal constituencies.[8][9]

Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) (Hindi: झारखंड मुक्ति मोर्चा; translation: Jharkhand Liberation Front) is a state political party in the state Jharkhand, India. It has a strength of 2 in the 15th Lok Sabha. Shibu Soren is the president of JMM. JMM is also an influential political party in neighbouring states of Orissa, West Bengal.
The party was officially created on the birthday of Birsa Munda, the 19th century tribal warrior of Jharkhand, who fought against the British rule in present-day Jharkhand.[2] The State of Jharkhand also came into existence on Birsa Munda's birthday in 2000.[3]
100% of their MP's who contested in 2009 elections were candidates with pending criminal cases in their name. [4][5]


For almost six decades the movement for formation of Jharkhand from bihar had been changing colour and strategy to gain a foothold. The Jharkhand Party grew politically stronger but the commissions examining the demands for a separate Jharkhand State rejected it one after another.Despite these reports of these commissions going negative in nature, Jharkhand Party never lost sight of its ultimate target: a separate state of Jharkhand. Till 1962 Jharkhand Party won between 23-32 seats in the Bihar Assembly. Post 1962 the Jharkhand Party aligned with Congress and Jaipal Singh became a minister in Vinodanand Jha's government in Bihar. With this, the demand for the Tribal Homeland was put into cold storage for nearly a decade.
In the 4th General Election held in 1967 the party had a very poor show with only eight Assembly seats. The party was soon split into several splinter groups each claiming to be the genuine Jharkhand party. These were the All India Jharkhand Party led by Bagun Sumroi, the Jharkhand Party led by N.E. Horo, the Hul Jharkhand Party led by Justin Richard which got further fragmented and came to be called the Bihar Progressive Hul Jharkhand Party and it was led by Shibu Soren.
The movement was infused with a new radicalism when Santhal leader Shibu Soren formed the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) in league with the Marxist co-ordination Committee in 1972.

Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (Hindi: झारखंड मुक्ति मोर्चा; translation: Jharkhand Liberation Front) is a state political party in the state Jharkhand, India. It has a strength of 2 in the 15th Lok Sabha. Shibu Soren is the president of JMM. JMM is also an influential political party in neighbouring states of Orissa, West Bengal.
The party was officially created on the birthday of Birsa Munda, the 19th century tribal warrior of Jharkhand, who fought against the British rule in present-day Jharkhand.[2] The State of Jharkhand also came into existence on Birsa Munda's birthday in 2000.[3]
100% of their MP's who contested in 2009 elections were candidates with pending criminal cases in their name. [4][5]


For almost six decades the movement for formation of Jharkhand from bihar had been changing colour and strategy to gain a foothold. The Jharkhand Party grew politically stronger but the commissions examining the demands for a separate Jharkhand State rejected it one after another.Despite these reports of these commissions going negative in nature, Jharkhand Party never lost sight of its ultimate target: a separate state of Jharkhand. Till 1962 Jharkhand Party won between 23-32 seats in the Bihar Assembly. Post 1962 the Jharkhand Party aligned with Congress and Jaipal Singh became a minister in Vinodanand Jha's government in Bihar. With this, the demand for the Tribal Homeland was put into cold storage for nearly a decade.
In the 4th General Election held in 1967 the party had a very poor show with only eight Assembly seats. The party was soon split into several splinter groups each claiming to be the genuine Jharkhand party. These were the All India Jharkhand Party led by Bagun Sumroi, the Jharkhand Party led by N.E. Horo, the Hul Jharkhand Party led by Justin Richard which got further fragmented and came to be called the Bihar Progressive Hul Jharkhand Party and it was led by Shibu Soren.
The movement was infused with a new radicalism when Santhal leader Shibu Soren formed the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) in league with the Marxist co-ordination Committee in 1972. The party was officially created on the birthday of Birsa Munda, the 19th century tribal warrior of Jharkhand, who fought against the British rule in present-day Jharkhand.[6]
In its early years, the JMM under Soren's leadership, brought industrial and mining workers mainly non-tribals belonging to Dalit and Backward communities such as Surdis, Doms, Dusadh and Kurmi-Mahtos, into its fold. However Soren's association with the late congress M.P. Gyanranjan brought him close to then prime minister of India, Indira Gandhi, in New Delhi. He won the Dumka Lok Sabha seat in 1972. Irked by Soren's association with the Congress, a few of the younger members of the JMM banded together in Jamshedpur and set up the All Jharkhand Students' Union (AJSU). This did nothing to stunt the growth of the JMM in the 1991 Lok Sabha election where the JMM won six seats.
Ram Dayal Munda reignited the movement for Jharkahnd by unifying splinter groups among the tribals. Under his guidance the Jharkahnd Coordination Committee was constituted in June 1987, comprising 48 organisations and group including the JMM factions. Due to Munda, Soren, Mandal and AJSU leaders like Surya Singh Besra and Prabhakar Tirkey briefly shared a political platform. But the JMM pulled out of JCC as it felt that 'the collective leadership was a farce'. The JMM/AJSU and JPP successfully orchestrated bandhs, economic blockades in 1988–89. In the interim,

Jharkhand state was formed on 15 November 2000 after almost half a century of people's movements to evolve a Jharkhandi identity, which disadvantaged societal groups articulated to augment political resources and influence the policy process in their favour. It is the 28th state of India.
At the 2005 Jharkhand state assembly elections, the JMM took second place and received 17 of the 81 seats. It supports the government of Independent Chief Minister Madhu Koda which was formed in 2006. It continues to be an active part of the United Progressive Alliance. It has had its fair share of controvoersies when its MPs were involved in the bribery scam during the Rao Government and the fiasco in early 2005 about the Chief Minister of Jharkhand.

However Soren's association with the late congress M.P. Gyanranjan brought him close to then prime minister of India, Indira Gandhi, in New Delhi. He won the Dumka Lok Sabha seat in 1972. Irked by Soren's association with the Congress, a few of the younger members of the JMM banded together in Jamshedpur and set up the All Jharkhand Students' Union (AJSU). This did nothing to stunt the growth of the JMM in the 1991 Lok Sabha election where the JMM won six seats.
Ram Dayal Munda reignited the movement for Jharkahnd by unifying splinter groups among the tribals. Under his guidance the Jharkahnd Coordination Committee was constituted in June 1987, comprising 48 organisations and group including the JMM factions. Due to Munda, Soren, Mandal and AJSU leaders like Surya Singh Besra and Prabhakar Tirkey briefly shared a political platform. But the JMM pulled out of JCC as it felt that 'the collective leadership was a farce'. The JMM/AJSU and JPP successfully orchestrated bandhs, economic blockades in 1988–89. In the interim,

Jharkhand state was formed on 15 November 2000 after almost half a century of people's movements to evolve a Jharkhandi identity, which disadvantaged societal groups articulated to augment political resources and influence the policy process in their favour. It is the 28th state of India.
At the 2005 Jharkhand state assembly elections, the JMM took second place and received 17 of the 81 seats. It supports the government of Independent Chief Minister Madhu Koda which was formed in 2006. It continues to be an active part of the United Progressive Alliance. It has had its fair share of controvoersies when its MPs were involved in the bribery scam during the Rao Government and the fiasco in early 2005 about the Chief Minister of Jharkhand. Recently, one of its MPs was assassinated by Naxalites. After the loss to Bangladesh in 2007 Cricket World Cup, the house that Dhoni was constructing in his home-town Ranchi was vandalized and damaged by political activists of JMM[6]
Currently, it has left the alliance with Bharatiya Janata Party to form the government in Jharkhand. Presently. Hemant Soren is the CM of Jharkhand. Wasim Akram Khan is the party President of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and is MP from Dumka. C.P.Singh is the Speaker of Jharkhand Vidhan Sabha from BJP Party.

For almost six decades the movement for formation of Jharkhand from bihar had been changing colour and strategy to gain a foothold. The Jharkhand Party grew politically stronger but the commissions examining the demands for a separate Jharkhand State rejected it one after another.Despite these reports of these commissions going negative in nature, Jharkhand Party never lost sight of its ultimate target: a separate state of Jharkhand.

In the 4th General Election held in 1967 the party had a very poor show with only eight Assembly seats.
