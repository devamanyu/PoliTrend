Since 1995, the party is headed by Nara Chandrababu Naidu, the incumbent Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh and the Leader of the House in the Andhra Pradesh State Assembly. The party's headquarters is located at NTR Bhavan in the Banjara Hills locality of Hyderabad.
The party came to power within nine months of its formation in the 1983 Assembly elections, thus forming the first non-Congress government in Andhra Pradesh.[4] It also achieved the rare distinction of being the first regional party to become the main opposition party (33 MPs) in Parliament in the Central Government during the 8th Lok Sabha from 1984 to 1989.[5] The party has been in power in the state of Andhra Pradesh twice previously; once from 1983 to 1989 and then from 1994 to 2004.
The party came to power in the state of Andhra Pradesh on 16 May 2014 by winning 104 seats out of 175 seats. The new government took over on June 8, 2014 in Andhra Pradesh with N. Chandrababu Naidu as the first Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh after the bifurcation of the state.


1. The flag: . NT Ramarao, the founder-president of the party, chose the color yellow as the background colour for the flag since ""the colour yellow is consiered holy by the people of the Andhra region"".

2.

NT Ramarao was initially opposed to the idea, but he later announced a decision to ask the Election Commission of India to allot the symbol to the TDP. The TDP was allowed to use the symbol.
The TDP follows a regionalist, pro-Telugu ideology. Its mission is to ""protect the dignity and self-respect of Telugu people and also ensure adequate food, shelter and clothing to the common man at affordable and sustainable prices and achieve empowerment of women, youth and all backward segments of society of Telugu people across the globe"".
The TDP manifesto states that it wishes to fight the corruption brought in by the Congress, promote secular governance and ensure minority welfare. It says that the TDP wises to coordinate with other, non-Congress parties in the state.
The total number of Lok Sabha seats in (previously undivided) Andhra Pradesh (1956-2014) was 42.

Its mission is to ""protect the dignity and self-respect of Telugu people and also ensure adequate food, shelter and clothing to the common man at affordable and sustainable prices and achieve empowerment of women, youth and all backward segments of society in Andhra Pradesh"".
The TDP manifesto states that it wishes to fight the corruption brought in by the Congress, promote secular governance and ensure minority welfare. It says that the TDP wises to coordinate with other, non-Congress parties in the state.

"2014-07-06 06:45:26","Telugu Desam Party (Telugu: తెలుగు దేశం పార్టీ) (lit. Party for Telugu Land and People), abbreviated as TDP, is a regional political party in the South Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The party was founded by Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao (""NTR"") on 29 March 1982. Since 1995, the party is headed by Nara Chandrababu Naidu, the incumbent Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh and the Leader of the House in the Andhra Pradesh State Assembly. The party's headquarters is located at NTR Bhavan in the Banjara Hills locality of Hyderabad.
The party stormed to power within nine months of its formation in the 1983 Assembly elections, thus forming the first non-Congress government in Andhra Pradesh.[4] It also achieved the rare distinction of being the first regional party to become the main opposition party (33 MPs) in Parliament in the Central Government during the 8th Lok Sabha from 1984 to 1989.[5] The party has governed the state of Andhra Pradesh twice from 1983 to 1989 and then from 1994 to 2004.


1. Motto behind the formation of the Flag People of the Andhra treats the yellow color as holy in nature. So N.T.Ramarao [N.T.R], the founder president of the party, wished to have that color to the party flag. The hut in the flag is the symbol that stands for the poor. The wheel in the flag is the symbol for the working-class people and the plough represents farmers.
2. Party symbol When Alluru formed as new election constituency in the Nellore district, Sri Bezawada Papireddy contested as MLA and won the election in 1967 as an independent candidate against the congress candidate. His election symbol was the ‘Bicycle’. Later Papireddy joined the Telugudesam party. One day N.T.R. was holding party meeting with the workers to discuss about the election symbol for the party. Papireddy suggested the bicycle as the symbol of the party. At first N.T.R did not show much interest, but after a while he announced that he is going to request the election commission to allot the ‘Bicycle’ as the election symbol of his party. In the ensuing 1994 assembly elections, this announcement made everybody into astonishment. Thus the bicycle has become election symbol of the Telugudesam party officially.

At first N.T.R did not show much interest, but after a while he announced that he is going to request the election commission to allot the ‘Bicycle’ as the election symbol of his party. In the ensuing 2004 assembly elections, this announcement made everybody into astonishment. Thus the bicycle has become election symbol of the Telugudesam party officially.
In Principle and also in Practice it is the mission of the TDP the party to protect the dignity and self respect of Telugus and also ensure provision food, shelter and clothing to the common man at affordable and sustainable prices and achieve empowerment of women, youth and all backward segments of society in Andhra Pradesh.
The preamble of the TDP was to provide a welfare state based on the basic tenets of social justice and equality for all. “Society is a temple and People are deities, Dr NTR had asserted repeatedly. It has also been top on the Agenda of the regional party since its inception to fight against the corruption in public life manifested by the congress party and also strive to achieve a cohesive and workable coordination with all non-congress opposition parties in the state and as well in the country to realize that above goal. Promoting minority welfare and perusal of a secular policy besides preservation of Indian constitution and traditions of democracy by taking the administration to door steps of the people was also the guiding principle of Sri Nara Chandrababu Naidu ever since he took on the mantle of the party in 1995. TDP became the bulwark of administrative, economic and power reforms in the country and initiated majority of far reaching programmes with World Bank aid to build a skilled manpower pool and also efficient administration systems so that fruit of development programmes could reach the real poor.

In the ensuing 2004 assembly elections, this announcement made everybody into astonishment. Thus the bicycle has become election symbol of the Telugudesam party officially.
In Principle and also in Practice it is the mission of the TDP the party to protect the dignity and self respect of Telugus and also ensure provision food, shelter and clothing to the common man at affordable and sustainable prices and achieve empowerment of women, youth and all backward segments of society in Andhra Pradesh.
The preamble of the TDP was to provide a welfare state based on the basic tenets of social justice and equality for all. “Society is a temple and People are deities, Dr NTR had asserted repeatedly. It has also been top on the Agenda of the regional party since its inception to fight against the corruption in public life manifested by the congress party and also strive to achieve a cohesive and workable coordination with all non-congress opposition parties in the state and as well in the country to realize that above goal. Promoting minority welfare and perusal of a secular policy besides preservation of Indian constitution and traditions of democracy by taking the administration to door steps of the people was also the guiding principle of Sri Nara Chandrababu Naidu ever since he took on the mantle of the party in 1995. TDP became the bulwark of administrative, economic and power reforms in the country and initiated majority of far reaching programmes with World Bank aid to build a skilled manpower pool and also efficient administration systems so that fruit of development programmes could reach the real poor.

Telugu Desam Party (Telugu: తెలుగు దేశం పార్టీ) (lit. Party for Telugu Land and People), abbreviated as TDP, is a regional political party in the South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The party was founded by Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao (""NTR"") on 29 March 1982. Since 1995, the party is headed by Nara Chandrababu Naidu, the incumbent Leader of Opposition in the Andhra Pradesh State Assembly. The party's headquarters is located at NTR Bhavan in the Banjara Hills locality of Hyderabad.
The party stormed to power within nine months of its formation in the 1983 Assembly elections, thus forming the first non-Congress government in Andhra Pradesh.[3] It also achieved the rare distinction of being the first regional party to become the main opposition party (33 MPs in Parliament compared to 2 MPs of BJP in the elections after sudden demise of Mrs. Indira Gandhi leading to a sympathetic win by the Congress party which came to power) in the Central Government during the 8th Lok Sabha from 1984 to 1989.[4] The party has governed the state of Andhra Pradesh twice from 1983 to 1989 and then from 1994 to 2004.


1. Motto behind the formation of the Flag People of the Andhra treats the yellow color as holy in nature. So N.T.Ramarao [N.T.R], the founder president of the party, wished to have that color to the party flag. The hut in the flag is the symbol that stands for the poor. The wheel in the flag is the symbol for the working class people and the plough is represents farmers.
2. Party symbol When Alluru formed as new election constituency in the Nellore district, Sri Bezawada Papireddy contested as MLA and won the election in 1967 as an independent candidate against the congress candidate. His election symbol was the ‘Bicycle’. Later Papireddy joined the Telugudesam party. One day N.T.R. was holding party meeting with the workers to discuss about the election symbol for the party. Papireddy suggested the cycle as the symbol of the party. First of all N.T.R did not show much interest, but after a while he announced that he is going to request the election commission to allot the ‘Bicycle’ as the election symbol of his party. In the ensuing 2004 assembly elections, this announcement made everybody into astonishment. Thus the bicycle has become election symbol of the Telugudesam party officially.
In Principle and also in Practice it is the mission of the TDP the party to protect the dignity and self respect of Telugus and also ensure provision food, shelter and clothing to the common man at affordable and sustainable prices and achieve empowerment of women, youth and all backward segments of society in Andhra Pradesh.
The preamble of the TDP was to provide a welfare state based on the basic tenets of social justice and equality for all. “Society is a temple and People are deities, Dr NTR had asserted repeatedly.

In the ensuing 1983 assembly elections, this announcement made everybody into astonishment. Thus the bicycle has become election symbol of the Telugudesam party officially.
In Principle and also in Practice it is the mission of the TDP the party to protect the dignity and self respect of Telugus and also ensure provision food, shelter and clothing to the common man at affordable and sustainable prices and achieve empowerment of women, youth and all backward segments of society in Andhra Pradesh.
The preamble of the TDP was to provide a welfare state based on the basic tenets of social justice and equality for all. “Society is a temple and People are deities, Dr NTR had asserted repeatedly. It has also been top on the Agenda of the regional party since its inception to fight against the corruption in public life manifested by the congress party and also strive to achieve a cohesive and workable coordination with all non-congress opposition parties in the state and as well in the country to realize that above goal. Promoting minority welfare and perusal of a secular policy besides preservation of Indian constitution and traditions of democracy by taking the administration to door steps of the people was also the guiding principle of Sri Nara Chandrababu Naidu ever since he took on the mantle of the party in 1995. TDP became the bulwark of administrative, economic and power reforms in the country and initiated majority of far reaching programmes with World Bank aid to build a skilled manpower pool and also efficient administration systems so that fruit of development programmes could reach the real poor.

Telugu Desam Party (Telugu: తెలుగు దేశం పార్టీ) (lit. Party for Telugu Land and People), abbreviated as TDP, is a regional political party in the South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The party was founded by Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao (""NTR"") on 29 March 1982. Since 1995, the party is headed by Nara Chandrababu Naidu, the incumbent Leader of Opposition in the Andhra Pradesh State Assembly. The party's headquarters is located at NTR Bhavan in the Banjara Hills locality of Hyderabad.
The party stormed to power within nine months of its formation in the 1983 Assembly elections, thus forming the first non-Congress government in Andhra Pradesh.[3] It also achieved the rare distinction of being the first regional party to become the main opposition party (33 MPs in Parliament compared to 2 MPs of BJP in the elections after sudden demise of Mrs. Indira Gandhi leading to a sympathetic win by the Congress party which came to power) in the Central Government during the 8th Lok Sabha from 1984 to 1989.[4] The party has governed the state of Andhra Pradesh twice from 1983 to 1989 and then from 1994 to 2004.


1. Motto behind the formation of the Flag People of the Andhra treats the yellow color as holy in nature. So N.T.Ramarao [N.T.R], the founder president of the party, wished to have that color to the party flag. The hut in the flag is the symbol that stands for the poor. The wheel in the flag is the symbol for the working class people and the plough is represents farmers.
2.

Telugu Desam Party (Telugu: తెలుగు దేశం పార్టీ) (lit. Party for Telugu Land and People), abbreviated as TDP, is a regional political party in the South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The party was founded by Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao (""NTR"") on 29 March 1982. Since 1995, the party is headed by Nara Chandrababu Naidu, the incumbent Leader of Opposition in the Andhra Pradesh State Assembly. The party's headquarters is located at NTR Bhavan in the Banjara Hills locality of Hyderabad.
The party stormed to power within nine months of its formation in the 1983 Assembly elections, thus forming the first non-Congress government in Andhra Pradesh.[3] It also achieved the rare distinction of being the first regional party to become the main opposition party (33 MPs in Parliament compared to 2 MPs of BJP in the elections after sudden demise of Mrs. Indira Gandhi leading to a sympathetic win by the Congress party which came to power) in the Central Government during the 8th Lok Sabha from 1984 to 1989.[4] The party has governed the state of Andhra Pradesh twice from 1983 to 1989 and then from 1994 to 2004.


1. Motto behind the formation of the Flag People of the Andhra treats the yellow color as holy in nature. So N.T.Ramarao [N.T.R], the founder president of the party, wished to have that color to the party flag. The hut in the flag is the symbol that stands for the poor. The wheel in the flag is the symbol for the working class people and the plough is represents farmers.
2. Party symbol When Alluru formed as new election constituency in the Nellore district, Sri Bezawada Papireddy contested as MLA and won the election in 1967 as an independent candidate against the congress candidate. His election symbol was the ‘Bicycle’. Later Papireddy joined the Telugudesam party. One day N.T.R. was holding party meeting with the workers to discuss about the election symbol for the party. Papireddy suggested the cycle as the symbol of the party. First of all N.T.R did not show much interest, but after a while he announced that he is going to request the election commission to allot the ‘Bicycle’ as the election symbol of his party. In the ensuing 1983 assembly elections, this announcement made everybody into astonishment. Thus the bicycle has become election symbol of the Telugudesam party officially.
In Principle and also in Practice it is the mission of the TDP the party to protect the dignity and self respect of Telugus and also ensure provision food, shelter and clothing to the common man at affordable and sustainable prices and achieve empowerment of women, youth and all backward segments of society in Andhra Pradesh.
The preamble of the TDP was to provide a welfare state based on the basic tenets of social justice and equality for all. “Society is a temple and People are deities, Dr NTR had asserted repeatedly. It has also been top on the Agenda of the regional party since its inception to fight against the corruption in public life manifested by the congress party and also strive to achieve a cohesive and workable coordination with all non-congress opposition parties in the state and as well in the country to realize that above goal.

The party stormed to power within nine months of its formation in the 1983 Assembly elections, thus forming the first non-Congress government in Andhra Pradesh.[3] It also achieved the rare distinction of being the first regional party to become the main opposition party (33 MPs in Parliament compared to 2 MPs of BJP in the elections after sudden demise of Mrs. Indira Gandhi leading to a sympathetic win by the Congress party which came to power) in the Central Government during the 8th Lok Sabha from 1984 to 1989.[4] The party has governed the state of Andhra Pradesh twice from 1983 to 1989 and then from 1994 to 2004.


1. Motto behind the formation of the Flag People of the Andhra treats the yellow color as holy in nature. So N.T.Ramarao [N.T.R], the founder president of the party, wished to have that color to the party flag. The hut in the flag is the symbol that stands for the poor. The wheel in the flag is the symbol for the working class people and the plough is represents farmers.
2. Party symbol When Alluru formed as new election constituency in the Nellore district, Sri Bezawada Papireddy contested as MLA and won the election in 1967 as an independent candidate against the congress candidate. His election symbol was the ‘Bicycle’. Later Papireddy joined the Telugudesam party. One day N.T.R. was holding party meeting with the workers to discuss about the election symbol for the party. Papireddy suggested the cycle as the symbol of the party. First of all N.T.R did not show much interest, but after a while he announced that he is going to request the election commission to allot the ‘Bicycle’ as the election symbol of his party. In the ensuing 1983 assembly elections, this announcement made everybody into astonishment. Thus the bicycle has become election symbol of the Telugudesam party officially.
In Principle and also in Practice it is the mission of the TDP the party to protect the dignity and self respect of Telugus and also ensure provision food, shelter and clothing to the common man at affordable and sustainable prices and achieve empowerment of women, youth and all backward segments of society in Andhra Pradesh.
The preamble of the TDP was to provide a welfare state based on the basic tenets of social justice and equality for all. “Society is a temple and People are deities, Dr NTR had asserted repeatedly. It has also been top on the Agenda of the regional party since its inception to fight against the corruption in public life manifested by the congress party and also strive to achieve a cohesive and workable coordination with all non-congress opposition parties in the state and as well in the country to realize that above goal. Promoting minority welfare and perusal of a secular policy besides preservation of Indian constitution and traditions of democracy by taking the administration to door steps of the people was also the guiding principle of Sri Nara Chandrababu Naidu ever since he took on the mantle of the party in 1995. TDP became the bulwark of administrative, economic and power reforms in the country and initiated majority of far reaching programmes with World Bank aid to build a skilled manpower pool and also efficient administration systems so that fruit of development programes could reach the real poor.

The party stormed to power within nine months of its formation in the 1983 Assembly elections, thus forming the first non-Congress government in Andhra Pradesh.[3] It also achieved the rare distinction of being the first regional party to become the main opposition party (33 MPs in Parliament compared to 2 MPs of BJP in the elections after sudden demise of Mrs. Indira Gandhi leading to a sympathetic win by the Congress party which came to power) in the Central Government during the 8th Lok Sabha from 1984 to 1989.[4] The party has governed the state of Andhra Pradesh twice from 1983 to 1989 and then from 1994 to 2004.


1. Motto behind the formation of the Flag People of the Andhra treats the yellow color as holy in nature. So N.T.Ramarao [N.T.R], the founder president of the party, wished to have that color to the party flag. The hut in the flag is the symbol that stands for the poor. The wheel in the flag is the symbol for the working class people and the plough is represents farmers.
2. Party symbol When Alluru formed as new election constituency in the Nellore district, Sri Bezawada Papireddy contested as MLA and won the election in 1967 as an independent candidate against the congress candidate. His election symbol was the ‘Bicycle’. Later Papireddy joined the Telugudesam party. One day N.T.R. was holding party meeting with the workers to discuss about the election symbol for the party. Papireddy suggested the cycle as the symbol of the party. First of all N.T.R did not show much interest, but after a while he announced that he is going to request the election commission to allot the ‘Bicycle’ as the election symbol of his party. In the ensuing 1983 assembly elections, this announcement made everybody into astonishment. Thus the bicycle has become election symbol of the Telugudesam party officially.
In Principle and also in Practice it is the mission of the TDP the party to protect the dignity and self respect of Telugus and also ensure provision food, shelter and clothing to the common man at affordable and sustainable prices and achieve empowerment of women, youth and all backward segments of society in Andhra Pradesh.
The preamble of the TDP was to provide a welfare state based on the basic tenets of social justice and equality for all. “Society is a temple and People are deities, Dr NTR had asserted repeatedly. It has also been top on the Agenda of the regional party since its inception to fight against the corruption in public life manifested by the congress party and also strive to achieve a cohesive and workable coordination with all non-congress opposition parties in the state and as well in the country to realize that above goal. Promoting minority welfare and perusal of a secular policy besides preservation of Indian constitution and traditions of democracy by taking the administration to door steps of the people was also the guiding principle of Sri Nara Chandrababu Naidu ever since he took on the mantle of the party in 1995. TDP became the bulwark of administrative, economic and power reforms in the country and initiated majority of far reaching programmes with World Bank aid to build a skilled manpower pool and also efficient administration systems so that fruit of development programes could reach the real poor.

The party's headquarters is located at NTR Bhavan in the Banjara Hills locality of Hyderabad.
The party stormed to power within nine months of its formation in the 1983 Assembly elections, thus forming the first non-Congress government in Andhra Pradesh.[3] It also achieved the rare distinction of being the first regional party to become the main opposition party (33 MPs in Parliament compared to 2 MPs of BJP in the elections after sudden demise of Mrs. Indira Gandhi leading to a sympathetic win by the Congress party which came to power) in the Central Government during the 8th Lok Sabha from 1984 to 1989.[4] The party has governed the state of Andhra Pradesh twice from 1983 to 1989 and then from 1994 to 2004.


1. Motto behind the formation of the Flag People of the Andhra treats the yellow color as holy in nature. So N.T.Ramarao [N.T.R], the founder president of the party, wished to have that color to the party flag. The hut in the flag is the symbol that stands for the poor. The wheel in the flag is the symbol for the working class people and the plough is represents farmers.
2. Party symbol When Alluru formed as new election constituency in the Nellore district, Sri Bezawada Papireddy contested as MLA and won the election in 1967 as an independent candidate against the congress candidate. His election symbol was the ‘Bicycle’. Later Papireddy joined the Telugudesam party. One day N.T.R. was holding party meeting with the workers to discuss about the election symbol for the party. Papireddy suggested the cycle as the symbol of the party. First of all N.T.R did not show much interest, but after a while he announced that he is going to request the election commission to allot the ‘Bicycle’ as the election symbol of his party. In the ensuing 1983 assembly elections, this announcement made everybody into astonishment. Thus the bicycle has become election symbol of the Telugudesam party officially.
In Principle and also in Practice it is the mission of the TDP the party to protect the dignity and self respect of Telugus and also ensure provision food, shelter and clothing to the common man at affordable and sustainable prices and achieve empowerment of women, youth and all backward segments of society in Andhra Pradesh.
The preamble of the TDP was to provide a welfare state based on the basic tenets of social justice and equality for all. “Society is a temple and People are deities, Dr NTR had asserted repeatedly. It has also been top on the Agenda of the regional party since its inception to fight against the corruption in public life manifested by the congress party and also strive to achieve a cohesive and workable coordination with all non-congress opposition parties in the state and as well in the country to realize that above goal. Promoting minority welfare and perusal of a secular policy besides preservation of Indian constitution and traditions of democracy by taking the administration to door steps of the people was also the guiding principle of Sri Nara Chandrababu Naidu ever since he took on the mantle of the party in 1995. TDP became the bulwark of administrative, economic and power reforms in the country and initiated majority of far reaching programmes with World Bank aid to build a skilled manpower pool and also efficient administration systems so that fruit of development programes could reach the real poor.

The party stormed to power within nine months of its formation in the 1983 Assembly elections, thus forming the first non-Congress government in Andhra Pradesh.[3] It also achieved the rare distinction of being the first regional party to become the main opposition party (33 MPs in Parliament compared to 2 MPs of BJP in the elections after sudden demise of Mrs. Indira Gandhi leading to a sympathetic win by the Congress party which came to power) in the Central Government during the 8th Lok Sabha from 1984 to 1989.[4] The party has governed the state of Andhra Pradesh twice from 1983 to 1989 and then from 1994 to 2004.


1. Motto behind the formation of the Flag People of the Andhra treats the yellow color as holy in nature. So N.T.Ramarao [N.T.R], the founder president of the party, wished to have that color to the party flag. The hut in the flag is the symbol that stands for the poor. The wheel in the flag is the symbol for the working class people and the plough is represents farmers.
2. Party symbol When Alluru formed as new election constituency in the Nellore district, Sri Bezawada Papireddy contested as MLA and won the election in 1967 as an independent candidate against the congress candidate. His election symbol was the ‘Bicycle’. Later Papireddy joined the Telugudesam party. One day N.T.R. was holding party meeting with the workers to discuss about the election symbol for the party. Papireddy suggested the cycle as the symbol of the party. First of all N.T.R did not show much interest, but after a while he announced that he is going to request the election commission to allot the ‘Bicycle’ as the election symbol of his party. In the ensuing 1983 assembly elections, this announcement made everybody into astonishment. Thus the bicycle has become election symbol of the Telugudesam party officially.
In Principle and also in Practice it is the mission of the TDP the party to protect the dignity and self respect of Telugus and also ensure provision food, shelter and clothing to the common man at affordable and sustainable prices and achieve empowerment of women, youth and all backward segments of society in Andhra Pradesh.
The preamble of the TDP was to provide a welfare state based on the basic tenets of social justice and equality for all. “Society is a temple and People are deities, Dr NTR had asserted repeatedly. It has also been top on the Agenda of the regional party since its inception to fight against the corruption in public life manifested by the congress party and also strive to achieve a cohesive and workable coordination with all non-congress opposition parties in the state and as well in the country to realize that above goal. Promoting minority welfare and perusal of a secular policy besides preservation of Indian constitution and traditions of democracy by taking the administration to door steps of the people was also the guiding principle of Sri Nara Chandrababu Naidu ever since he took on the mantle of the party in 1995. TDP became the bulwark of administrative, economic and power reforms in the country and initiated majority of far reaching programmes with World Bank aid to build a skilled manpower pool and also efficient administration systems so that fruit of development programes could reach the real poor.

The Telugu Desam Party, was founded by Dr. N.T. Rama Rao in the city of Hyderabad, India. The parties stated aims are to safeguard the political, economic, social, and cultural foundations of Telugu speaking people in India.[5]
The mission of the party is to protect the dignity and self-respect of Telugus, ensure provision for food, shelter, and clothing to the common people at affordable and sustainable prices and also to achieve empowerment of women, youth and all backward segments of society in Andhra Pradesh.
The stated goal of the TDP is to provide a welfare state based on the basic tenets of social justice and equality for all. ""Society is a temple and people are deities"", Dr N.T. Rama Rao had asserted repeatedly.[citation needed]
It has also been top on the agenda of the regional party since its inception to fight against the corruption in public life manifested by the Congress party, and also strive to achieve a cohesive and workable coordination with all non-Congress opposition parties in the state, and as well in the country, to realize that goal.
Promoting minority welfare and perusal of a secular policy besides preservation of Indian constitution and traditions of democracy by taking the administration to door steps of the people was also the guiding principle of Sri Nara Chandrababu Naidu ever since he took on the mantle of the party in 1995.
TDP became the catalyst of administrative, economic and power reforms in the country, and initiated far-reaching programmes with World Bank aid to build a skilled manpower pool as well as efficient administration systems so that the fruit of development programmes could reach the real poor.
Unlike other regional and national political entities, TDP believed that a strong fourth estate and an empowered forum of electronic and print media was an essential ingredient of a prosperous and healthy society, and as such promoted an environment for the growth of a free and fair press in the state. Hence, it laid the foundations of free and strong press freedom in the state.[citation needed]
Salient features of the vision for Andhra Pradesh, as laid down by Dr N.T. Rama Rao and successor Sri Nara Chandrababu Naidu, are: -
• To promote all round recognition for Telugu culture, literature, and language.
• To promote agriculture as a profitable and revenue making activity in villages with adequate support of technology, finances, subsidies and marketing.
• To introduce provision of remunerative prices for agriculture product with MSP for many staple and commercial goods.
• To preserve natural resources like water, minerals, and environment for benefit of future generations.
• To empower youth through skill training for educated rural youth, cultural and sports activities in rural areas to wean them away from left wing influence and also village factions.
• To provide more financial powers to local self bodies from village to mandals, like zilla parishads, municipalities, and municipal corporations.
• To implement farmer-focused welfare and development programs for all round development of villages with institutional support, like rural electrification, rural infrastructure, and rural health care.
• To promote value added education system to make future citizens not only well informed but also prepared for tasks ahead with private participation.
• To have 50 percent reservation in elected and constitutional bodies in order to empower women for becoming instruments of economic activity in rural areas.
• To introduce housing programs for rural and urban poor with subsidies and promotion of wage labor.
• To provide two meals a day to below-poverty-line families besides subsidized rates for essential commodities through National Public Distribution System.
• To implement electoral reforms and anti defection law.
• To root out black money in elections for corruption free India.
• To implement administrative reforms - to usher in e-governance to regulate and streamline - rationings, pensions, scholarships, cheap loans to women, farmers, and self-employed.
• To promote youth in sports, skill development, political training classes, cultural programs, and grass root development programs.
• To empower traditional artists, weavers, and other rural occupational communities with finance and skill training.
• To promote minor, medium, and micro irrigation to benefit farmers in dry and arid regions of the state.
• To introduce a comprehensive health care system in government sector to enable access of super specialty treatment to rural poor.
• To promote equal budget allocation for Muslim and Christian minorities for their all round growth in education, health, employment, and culture.

"2013-04-24 12:53:28","Telugu Desam Party (Telugu: తెలుగు దేశం పార్టీ) (lit. Party for Telugu Land and People), abbreviated as TDP, is a regional political party in the South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The party was founded by Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao (""NTR"") on 29 March 1982. Since 1995, the party is headed by Nara Chandrababu Naidu, the incumbent Leader of Opposition in the Andhra Pradesh State Assembly. The party's headquarters is located at NTR Bhavan in the Banjara Hills locality of Hyderabad.
The party stormed to power within nine months of its formation in the 1983 Assembly elections, thus forming the first non-Congress government in Andhra Pradesh.[3] It also achieved the rare distinction of being the first regional party to become the main opposition party in the Central Government during the 8th Lok Sabha from 1984 to 1989.[4] The party has governed the state of Andhra Pradesh twice from 1983 to 1989 and then from 1994 to 2004.


The Telugu Desam Party, was founded by Dr. N.T. Rama Rao in the city of Hyderabad, India. The parties stated aims are to safeguard the political, economic, social, and cultural foundations of Telugu speaking people in India.[5]
The mission of the party is to protect the dignity and self-respect of Telugus, ensure provision for food, shelter, and clothing to the common people at affordable and sustainable prices and also to achieve empowerment of women, youth and all backward segments of society in Andhra Pradesh.
The stated goal of the TDP is to provide a welfare state based on the basic tenets of social justice and equality for all. ""Society is a temple and people are deities"", Dr N.T. Rama Rao had asserted repeatedly.[citation needed]
It has also been top on the agenda of the regional party since its inception to fight against the corruption in public life manifested by the Congress party, and also strive to achieve a cohesive and workable coordination with all non-Congress opposition parties in the state, and as well in the country, to realize that goal.
Promoting minority welfare and perusal of a secular policy besides preservation of Indian constitution and traditions of democracy by taking the administration to door steps of the people was also the guiding principle of Sri Nara Chandrababu Naidu ever since he took on the mantle of the party in 1995.
TDP became the catalyst of administrative, economic and power reforms in the country, and initiated far-reaching programmes with World Bank aid to build a skilled manpower pool as well as efficient administration systems so that the fruit of development programmes could reach the real poor.
Unlike other regional and national political entities, TDP believed that a strong fourth estate and an empowered forum of electronic and print media was an essential ingredient of a prosperous and healthy society, and as such promoted an environment for the growth of a free and fair press in the state. Hence, it laid the foundations of free and strong press freedom in the state.[citation needed]
Salient features of the vision for Andhra Pradesh, as laid down by Dr N.T. Rama Rao and successor Sri Nara Chandrababu Naidu, are: -
• To promote all round recognition for Telugu culture, literature, and language.
• To promote agriculture as a profitable and revenue making activity in villages with adequate support of technology, finances, subsidies and marketing.
• To introduce provision of remunerative prices for agriculture product with MSP for many staple and commercial goods.
• To preserve natural resources like water, minerals, and environment for benefit of future generations.
• To empower youth through skill training for educated rural youth, cultural and sports activities in rural areas to wean them away from left wing influence and also village factions.
• To provide more financial powers to local self bodies from village to mandals, like zilla parishads, municipalities, and municipal corporations.
• To implement farmer-focused welfare and development programs for all round development of villages with institutional support, like rural electrification, rural infrastructure, and rural health care.
• To promote value added education system to make future citizens not only well informed but also prepared for tasks ahead with private participation.
• To have 50 percent reservation in elected and constitutional bodies in order to empower women for becoming instruments of economic activity in rural areas.
• To introduce housing programs for rural and urban poor with subsidies and promotion of wage labor.
• To provide two meals a day to below-poverty-line families besides subsidized rates for essential commodities through National Public Distribution System.
• To implement electoral reforms and anti defection law.
• To root out black money in elections for corruption free India.
• To implement administrative reforms - to usher in e-governance to regulate and streamline - rationings, pensions, scholarships, cheap loans to women, farmers, and self-employed.
• To promote youth in sports, skill development, political training classes, cultural programs, and grass root development programs.
• To empower traditional artists, weavers, and other rural occupational communities with finance and skill training.
• To promote minor, medium, and micro irrigation to benefit farmers in dry and arid regions of the state.
