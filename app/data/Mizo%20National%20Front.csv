"2017-06-16 16:03:21","The Mizo National Front (abbreviated MNF) is a regional political party in Mizoram, India. MNF emerged from the Mizo National Famine Front, which was formed by Pu Laldenga to protest against the inaction of the Indian central government towards the famine situation in the Mizo areas of the Assam state in 1959. It staged a major uprising in 1966, followed by years of underground activities. In 1986, it signed the Mizo Accord with the Government of India, renouncing secession and violence.
MNF won elections and formed state government in Mizoram twice, first under Laldenga (1986–88) and then under Zoramthanga (1998–2008). In 2008, it suffered a strong incumbency wave and managed to win only 3 seats in the elections.
Currently it is a part of North-East Regional Political Front consisting of political parties of the northeast which has supported the National Democratic Alliance (India)


In 1959, Mizo Hills was devastated by a great famine known in Mizo history as 'Mautam'. The cause of the famine was attributed to flowering of bamboos which consequently resulted in rat population boom in large numbers. After eating up bamboos seeds, the rats turned towards crops and infested the huts and houses and became a plaque to the Villages. The havoc created by the rats was terrible and very little of the grain was harvested. For sustenance, many Mizos had to collect roots and leaves from the jungles while a considerable number died of starvation. Earlier in 1955, Mizo Cultural Society was formed and Laldenga was its Secretary. In March 1960, the name of the Mizo Cultural Society was changed to 'Mautam front'. During the famine of 1959–1960, this society took lead in demanding relief and managed to attract the attention of all sections of the people. In September 1960, the Society adopted the name Mizo National Famine Front (MNFF). The MNFF gained considerable popularity as a large number of Mizo Youth assisted in transporting rice and other essential commodities to interior villages.
The Mizo National Famine Front, which was originally formed to help ease the immense sufferings of the people during the severe Mautam Famine in Mizoram, was converted into Mizo National Front (MNF) on October 22, 1961. The first OB leaders elected were, President Laldenga, Vice President JF Manliana, General Secy. R. Vanlawma, and Treasurer Rochhinga and the ways in which the Indian authority of the day handled the famine left the people disillusioned. The wave of secessionist and armed insurrection was running high among the Mizos. In 1966, MNF led a major uprising against the government, but failed to gain administrative control of the Mizo district. The secessionist movement held on for about two decades. During that time, they invaded Burma claiming chin state and Tahan belong to Mizoram since most of the resident in Tahan are Mizo.
This chapter of insurgency finally came to a close with the signing of the Mizoram Peace Accord on June 30, 1986 between the underground government of the Mizo National Front and the Government of India. Under the terms of the peace accord, Mizoram was granted statehood in February 1987. Laldenga became Chief Minister, but soon lost power due to defections in the party.
Former guerrilla leader Pu Zoramthanga became party leader following the death of Laldenga in 1990. In 1998 and 2003 MNF won the state assembly elections, and Pu Zoramthanga was chief minister for 10 years. In the 2003 elections MNF won 21 out of 40 seats in the state assembly, and got 132 505 votes (31,66%). MNF was part of the National Democratic Alliance, but later withdrew in 2007. Officers of 2017 were:
The MNF suffered a heavy defeat in the 2008 state assembly elections, winning only 3 of the 40 seats, and the Indian National Congress swept to power, and winning only 5 of the 40 seats in the 2013 state assembly election. They were able to secure only 30.65% votes in the state.[2] The party has come out very strongly against idol-worship[3]
In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections MNF won the only seat of Mizoram. The MNF candidate Pu Vanlalzawma got 182 864 votes (52,46%). MNF abstained in the vote of confidence on 22 July 2008 to maintain distance from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and United Progressive Alliance.[citation needed]
For the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, it formed an alliance called United Democratic Front with seven other parties including BJP, to contest the only seat in Mizoram.[4]

MNF emerged from the Mizo National Famine Front, which was formed by Pu Laldenga to protest against the inaction of the Indian central government towards the famine situation in the Mizo areas of the Assam state in 1959. It staged a major uprising in 1966, followed by years of underground activities. In 1986, it signed the Mizo Accord with the Government of India, renouncing secession and violence.
MNF won elections and formed state government in Mizoram twice, first under Laldenga (1986–88) and then under Zoramthanga (1998–2008). In 2008, it suffered a strong incumbency wave and managed to win only 3 seats in the elections.
Currently it is a part of North-East Regional Political Front consisting of political parties of the northeast which has supported the National Democratic Alliance (India)


In 1959, Mizo Hills was devastated by a great famine known in Mizo history as 'Mautam'. The cause of the famine was attributed to flowering of bamboos which consequently resulted in rat population boom in large numbers. After eating up bamboos seeds, the rats turned towards crops and infested the huts and houses and became a plaque to the Villages. The havoc created by the rats was terrible and very little of the grain was harvested. For sustenance, many Mizos had to collect roots and leaves from the jungles while a considerable number died of starvation. Earlier in 1955, Mizo Cultural Society was formed and Laldenga was its Secretary. In March 1960, the name of the Mizo Cultural Society was changed to 'Mautam front'. During the famine of 1959–1960, this society took lead in demanding relief and managed to attract the attention of all sections of the people. In September 1960, the Society adopted the name Mizo National Famine Front (MNFF). The MNFF gained considerable popularity as a large number of Mizo Youth assisted in transporting rice and other essential commodities to interior villages.
The Mizo National Famine Front, which was originally formed to help ease the immense sufferings of the people during the severe Mautam Famine in Mizoram, was converted into Mizo National Front (MNF) on October 22, 1961. The first OB leaders elected were, President Laldenga, Vice President JF Manliana, General Secy. R. Vanlawma, and Treasurer Rochhinga and the ways in which the Indian authority of the day handled the famine left the people disillusioned. The wave of secessionist and armed insurrection was running high among the Mizos. In 1966, MNF led a major uprising against the government, but failed to gain administrative control of the Mizo district. The secessionist movement held on for about two decades. During that time, they invaded Burma claiming chin state and Tahan belong to Mizoram since most of the resident in Tahan are Mizo.
This chapter of insurgency finally came to a close with the signing of the Mizoram Peace Accord on June 30, 1986 between the underground government of the Mizo National Front and the Government of India. Under the terms of the peace accord, Mizoram was granted statehood in February 1987. Laldenga became Chief Minister, but soon lost power due to defections in the party.
Former guerrilla leader Pu Zoramthanga became party leader following the death of Laldenga in 1990. In 1998 and 2003 MNF won the state assembly elections, and Pu Zoramthanga was chief minister for 10 years. In the 2003 elections MNF won 21 out of 40 seats in the state assembly, and got 132 505 votes (31,66%). MNF was part of the National Democratic Alliance, but later withdrew in 2007. Officers as of 2007 were:
The MNF suffered a heavy defeat in the 2008 state assembly elections, winning only 3 of the 40 seats, and the Indian National Congress swept to power. They were able to secure only 30.65% votes in the state.[2] The party has come out very strongly against idol-worship[3]
In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections MNF won the only seat of Mizoram. The MNF candidate Pu Vanlalzawma got 182 864 votes (52,46%). MNF abstained in the vote of confidence on 22 July 2008 to maintain distance from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and United Progressive Alliance.[citation needed]
For the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, it formed an alliance called United Democratic Front with seven other parties including BJP, to contest the only seat in Mizoram.[4]

MNF won elections and formed state government in Mizoram twice, first under Laldenga (1986–88) and then under Zoramthanga (1998–2008). In 2008, it suffered a strong incumbency wave and managed to win only 3 seats in the elections.
Currently it is a part of North-East Regional Political Front consisting of political parties of the northeast which has supported the National Democratic Alliance (India)


In 1959, Mizo Hills was devastated by a great famine known in Mizo history as 'Mautam'. The cause of the famine was attributed to flowering of bamboos which consequently resulted in rat population boom in large numbers. After eating up bamboos seeds, the rats turned towards crops and infested the huts and houses and became a plaque to the Villages. The havoc created by the rats was terrible and very little of the grain was harvested. For sustenance, many Mizos had to collect roots and leaves from the jungles while a considerable number died of starvation. Earlier in 1955, Mizo Cultural Society was formed and Laldenga was its Secretary. In March 1960, the name of the Mizo Cultural Society was changed to 'Mautam front'. During the famine of 1959–1960, this society took lead in demanding relief and managed to attract the attention of all sections of the people. In September 1960, the Society adopted the name Mizo National Famine Front (MNFF). The MNFF gained considerable popularity as a large number of Mizo Youth assisted in transporting rice and other essential commodities to interior villages.
The Mizo National Famine Front, which was originally formed to help ease the immense sufferings of the people during the severe Mautam Famine in Mizoram, was converted into Mizo National Front (MNF) on October 22, 1961. The first OB leaders elected were, President Laldenga, Vice President JF Manliana, General Secy. R. Vanlawma, and Treasurer Rochhinga and the ways in which the Indian authority of the day handled the famine left the people disillusioned. The wave of secessionist and armed insurrection was running high among the Mizos. In 1966, MNF led a major uprising against the government, but failed to gain administrative control of the Mizo district. The secessionist movement held on for about two decades. During that time, they invaded Burma claiming chin state and Tahan belong to Mizoram since most of the resident in Tahan are Mizo.
This chapter of insurgency finally came to a close with the signing of the Mizoram Peace Accord on June 30, 1986 between the underground government of the Mizo National Front and the Government of India. Under the terms of the peace accord, Mizoram was granted statehood in February 1987. Laldenga became Chief Minister, but soon lost power due to defections in the party.
Former guerrilla leader Pu Zoramthanga became party leader following the death of Laldenga in 1990. In 1998 and 2003 MNF won the state assembly elections, and Pu Zoramthanga was chief minister for 10 years. In the 2003 elections MNF won 21 out of 40 seats in the state assembly, and got 132 505 votes (31,66%). MNF was part of the National Democratic Alliance, but later withdrew in 2007. Officers as of 2007 were:
The MNF suffered a heavy defeat in the 2008 state assembly elections, winning only 3 of the 40 seats, and the Indian National Congress swept to power. They were able to secure only 30.65% votes in the state.[2] The party has come out very strongly against idol-worship[3]
In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections MNF won the only seat of Mizoram. The MNF candidate Pu Vanlalzawma got 182 864 votes (52,46%). MNF abstained in the vote of confidence on 22 July 2008 to maintain distance from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and United Progressive Alliance.[citation needed]
For the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, it formed an alliance called United Democratic Front with seven other parties including BJP, to contest the only seat in Mizoram.[4]

For sustenance, many Mizos had to collect roots and leaves from the jungles while a considerable number died of starvation. Earlier in 1955, Mizo Cultural Society was formed and Laldenga was its Secretary. In March 1960, the name of the Mizo Cultural Society was changed to 'Mautam front'. During the famine of 1959–1960, this society took lead in demanding relief and managed to attract the attention of all sections of the people. In September 1960, the Society adopted the name Mizo National Famine Front (MNFF). The MNFF gained considerable popularity as a large number of Mizo Youth assisted in transporting rice and other essential commodities to interior villages.
The Mizo National Famine Front, which was originally formed to help ease the immense sufferings of the people during the severe Mautam Famine in Mizoram, was converted into Mizo National Front (MNF) on October 22, 1961. The first OB leaders elected were, President Laldenga, Vice President JF Manliana, General Secy. R. Vanlawma, Treasurer Rochhinga and the ways in which the Indian authority of the day handled the famine left the people disillusioned. The wave of secessionist and armed insurrection was running high among the Mizos. In 1966, MNF led a major uprising against the government, but failed to gain administrative control of the Mizo district. The secessionist movement held on for about two decades. During that time, they invaded Burma claiming chin state and Tahan belong to Mizoram since most of the resident in Tahan are Mizo.
This chapter of insurgency finally came to a close with the signing of the Mizoram Peace Accord on June 30, 1986 between the underground government of the Mizo National Front and the Government of India. Under the terms of the peace accord, Mizoram was granted statehood in February 1987. Laldenga became Chief Minister, but soon lost power due to defections in the party.
Former guerrilla leader Pu Zoramthanga became party leader following the death of Laldenga in 1990. In 1998 and 2003 MNF won the state assembly elections, and Pu Zoramthanga was chief minister for 10 years. In the 2003 elections MNF won 21 out of 40 seats in the state assembly, and got 132 505 votes (31,66%). MNF was part of the National Democratic Alliance, but later withdrew in 2007. Officers as of 2007 were:
The MNF suffered a heavy defeat in the 2008 state assembly elections, winning only 3 of the 40 seats, and the Indian National Congress swept to power. They were able to secure only 30.65% votes in the state.[2] The party has came out very strongly against idol-worship[3]
In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections MNF won the only seat of Mizoram. The MNF candidate Pu Vanlalzawma got 182 864 votes (52,46%). MNF abstained in the vote of confidence on 22 July 2008 to maintain distance from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and United Progressive Alliance.[citation needed]
For the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, it formed an alliance called United Democratic Front with seven other parties including BJP, to contest the only seat in Mizoram.[4]

"2014-07-21 15:28:51","Mizo National Front (MNF) is a regional political party in Mizoram, India. MNF emerged from the Mizo National Famine Front, which was formed by Pu Laldenga to protest against the inaction of the Indian central government towards the famine situation in the Mizo areas of the Assam state in 1959. It staged a major uprising in 1966, followed by years of underground activities. In 1986, it signed the Mizo Accord with the Government of India, renouncing secession and violence.
MNF won elections and formed state government in Mizoram twice, first under Laldenga (1986–88) and then under Zoramthanga (1998–2008). In 2008, it suffered a strong incumbency wave managed to win only 3 seats in the elections.


In 1959, Mizo Hills was devastated by a great famine known in Mizo history as 'Mautam'. The cause of the famine was attributed to flowering of bamboos which consequently resulted in rat population boom in large numbers. After eating up bamboos seeds, the rats turned towards crops and infested the huts and houses and became a plaque to the Villages. The havoc created by the rats was terrible and very little of the grain was harvested. For sustenance, many Mizos had to collect roots and leaves from the jungles while a considerable number died of starvation. Earlier in 1955, Mizo Cultural Society was formed and Laldenga was its Secretary. In March 1960, the name of the Mizo Cultural Society was changed to 'Mautam front'. During the famine of 1959–1960, this society took lead in demanding relief and managed to attract the attention of all sections of the people. In September 1960, the Society adopted the name Mizo National Famine Front (MNFF). The MNFF gained considerable popularity as a large number of Mizo Youth assisted in transporting rice and other essential commodities to interior villages.
The Mizo National Famine Front, which was originally formed to help ease the immense sufferings of the people during the severe Mautam Famine in Mizoram, was converted into Mizo National Front (MNF) on October 22, 1961. The ways in which the authority of the day handled the famine left the people disillusioned. The wave of secessionist and armed insurrection was running high among the Mizos. In 1966, MNF led a major uprising against the government, but failed to gain administrative control of the Mizo district. The secessionist movement held on for about two decades. During that time, they invaded Burma claiming chin state and Tahan belong to Mizoram since most of the resident in Tahan are Mizo.
This chapter of insurgency finally came to a close with the signing of the Mizoram Peace Accord on June 30, 1986 between the underground government of the Mizo National Front and the Government of India. Under the terms of the peace accord, Mizoram was granted statehood in February 1987. Laldenga became Chief Minister, but soon lost power due to defections in the party.

The cause of the famine was attributed to flowering of bamboos which consequently resulted in rat population boom in large numbers. After eating up bamboos seeds, the rats turned towards crops and infested the huts and houses and became a plaque to the Villages. The havoc created by the rats was terrible and very little of the grain was harvested. For sustenance, many Mizos had to collect roots and leaves from the jungles while a considerable number died of starvation. Earlier in 1955, Mizo Cultural Society was formed and Laldenga was its Secretary. In March 1960, the name of the Mizo Cultural Society was changed to 'Mautam front'. During the famine of 1959-1960, this society took lead in demanding relief and managed to attract the attention of all sections of the people. In September 1960, the Society adopted the name Mizo National Famine Front (MNFF). The MNFF gained considerable popularity as a large number of Mizo Youth assisted in transporting rice and other essential commodities to interior villages. «»
The Mizo National Famine Front, which was originally formed to help ease the immense sufferings of the people during the severe Mautam Famine in Mizoram, was converted into Mizo National Front (MNF) on October 22, 1961. The ways in which the authority of the day handled the famine left the people disillusioned. The wave of secessionist and armed insurrection was running high among the Mizos. In 1966, MNF led a major uprising against the government, but failed to gain administrative control of the Mizo district. The secessionist movement held on for about two decades. During that time, they invaded Burma claiming chin state and Tahan belong to Mizoram since most of the resident in Tahan are Mizo.
This chapter of insurgency finally came to a close with the signing of the Mizoram Peace Accord on June 30, 1986 between the underground government of the Mizo National Front and the Government of India. Under the terms of the peace accord, Mizoram was granted statehood in February 1987. Laldenga became Chief Minister, but soon lost power due to defections in the party.
Former guerrilla leader Pu Zoramthanga became party leader following the death of Laldenga in 1990. In 1998 and 2003 MNF won the state assembly elections, and Pu Zoramthanga was chief minister for 10 years. In the 2003 elections MNF won 21 out of 40 seats in the state assembly, and got 132 505 votes (31,66%). MNF was part of the National Democratic Alliance, but later withdrew in 2007. Officers as of 2007 were: President: Pu Zoramthanga Vice President: Pu Tawnluia Treasurer: Pu Tlanghmingthanga
The MNF suffered a heavy defeat in the 2008 state assembly elections, winning only 3 of the 40 seats, and the Indian National Congress swept to power. They were able to secure only 30.65% votes in the state.[3] The party has came out very strongly against idol-worship[4]
In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections MNF won the only seat of Mizoram. The MNF candidate Pu Vanlalzawma got 182 864 votes (52,46%). MNF abstained in the vote of confidence on 22 July 2008 to maintain distance from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and United Progressive Alliance.[citation needed]
For the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, it formed an alliance called United Democratic Front with seven other parties including BJP, to contest the only seat in Mizoram.[5]

"2014-03-25 11:22:34","Mizo National Front (MNF) is a regional political party in Mizoram, India. MNF emerged from the Mizo National Famine Front, which was formed by Pu Laldenga to protest against the inaction of the Indian central government towards the famine situation in the Mizo areas of the Assam state in 1959. It staged a major uprising in 1966, followed by years of underground activities. In 1986, it signed the Mizo Accord with the Government of India, renouncing secession and violence. MNF suffered a strong incumbency wave in the 2008 Mizoram Election and lost all their MLA seats except three.


In 1959, Mizo Hills was devastated by a great famine known in Mizo history as 'Mautam' . The cause of the famine was attributed to flowering of bamboos which consequently resulted in rat population boom in large numbers. After eating up bamboos seeds, the rats turned towards crops and infested the huts and houses and became a plaque to the Villages. The havoc created by the rats was terrible and very little of the grain was harvested. For sustenance, many Mizos had to collect roots and leaves from the jungles while a considerable number died of starvation. Earlier in 1955, Mizo Cultural Society was formed and Laldenga was its Secretary. In March 1960, the name of the Mizo Cultural Society was changed to 'Mautam front'. During the famine of 1959-1960, this society took lead in demanding relief and managed to attract the attention of all sections of the people. In September 1960, the Society adopted the name Mizo National Famine Front (MNFF). The MNFF gained considerable popularity as a large number of Mizo Youth assisted in transporting rice and other essential commodities to interior villages. «»
The Mizo National Famine Front, which was originally formed to help ease the immense sufferings of the people during the severe Mautam Famine in Mizoram, was converted into Mizo National Front (MNF) on October 22, 1961. The ways in which the authority of the day handled the famine left the people disillusioned. The wave of secessionist and armed insurrection was running high among the Mizos. In 1966, MNF led a major uprising against the government, but failed to gain administrative control of the Mizo district. The secessionist movement held on for about two decades. During that time, they invaded Burma claiming chin state and Tahan belong to Mizoram since most of the resident in Tahan are Mizo.
This chapter of insurgency finally came to a close with the signing of the Mizoram Peace Accord on June 30, 1986 between the underground government of the Mizo National Front and the Government of India.

"2013-10-15 10:12:09","Mizo National Front (MNF) is a regional political party in Mizoram, India. MNF emerged out of the Mizo National Famine Front, which was formed by Pu Laldenga to protest against the inaction of the Indian central government towards the famine situation in the Mizo areas of the Assam state in 1959. It staged a major uprising in 1966, followed by years of underground activities. In 1986, it signed the Mizo Accord with the Government of India, renouncing secession and violence. MNF suffered a strong incumbency wave in the 2008 Mizoram Election and lost all their MLA seats except three.


In 1959, Mizo Hills was devastated by a great famine known in Mizo history as 'Mautam' . The cause of the famine was attributed to flowering of bamboos which consequently resulted in rat population boom in large numbers. After eating up bamboos seeds, the rats turned towards crops and infested the huts and houses and became a plaque to the Villages. The havoc created by the rats was terrible and very little of the grain was harvested. For sustenance, many Mizos had to collect roots and leaves from the jungles while a considerable number died of starvation. Earlier in 1955, Mizo Cultural Society was formed and Laldenga was its Secretary. In March 1960, the name of the Mizo Cultural Society was changed to 'Mautam front'. During the famine of 1959-1960, this society took lead in demanding relief and managed to attract the attention of all sections of the people. In September 1960, the Society adopted the name Mizo National Famine Front (MNFF). The MNFF gained considerable popularity as a large number of Mizo Youth assisted in transporting rice and other essential commodities to interior villages.
The Mizo National Famine Front, which was originally formed to help ease the immense sufferings of the people during the severe Mautam Famine in Mizoram, was converted into Mizo National Front (MNF) on October 22, 1961.

In 1966, MNF led a major uprising against the government, but failed to gain administrative control of the Mizo district. The secessionist movement held on for about two decades. During that time, they invaded Burma claiming chin state and Tahan belong to Mizoram since most of the resident in Tahan are Mizo.
This chapter of insurgency finally came to a close with the signing of the Mizoram Peace Accord on June 30, 1986 between the underground government of the Mizo National Front and the Government of India. Under the terms of the peace accord, Mizoram was granted statehood in February 1987. Laldenga became Chief Minister, but soon lost power due to defections in the party.
Former guerrilla leader Pu Zoramthanga became party leader following the death of Laldenga in 1990. In 1998 and 2003 MNF won the state assembly elections, and Pu Zoramthanga was chief minister for 10 years. In the 2003 elections MNF won 21 out of 40 seats in the state assembly, and got 132 505 votes (31,66%). MNF was part of the National Democratic Alliance, but later withdrew in 2007.[2] Officers as of 2007 were: President: Pu Zoramthanga Vice President: Pu Tawnluia Treasurer: Pu Tlanghmingthanga
The MNF suffered a heavy defeat in the 2008 state assembly elections, winning only 3 of the 40 seats, and the Indian National Congress swept to power.
In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections MNF won the only seat of Mizoram. The MNF candidate Pu Vanlalzawma got 182 864 votes (52,46%). MNF abstained in the vote of confidence on 22 July 2008 to maintain distance from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and United Progressive Alliance.[citation needed]

In 1959, Mizo Hills was devastated by a great famine known in Mizo history as 'Mautam' . The cause of the famine was attributed to flowering of bamboos which consequently resulted in rat population boom in large numbers. After eating up bamboos seeds, the rats turned towards crops and infested the huts and houses and became a plaque to the Villages. The havoc created by the rats was terrible and very little of the grain was harvested. For sustenance, many Mizos had to collect roots and leaves from the jungles while a considerable number died of starvation. Earlier in 1955, Mizo Cultural Society was formed and Laldenga was its Secretary. In March 1960, the name of the Mizo Cultural Society was changed to 'Mautam front'. During the famine of 1959-1960, this society took lead in demanding relief and managed to attract the attention of all sections of the people. In September 1960, the Society adopted the name Mizo National Famine Front (MNFF). The MNFF gained considerable popularity as a large number of Mizo Youth assisted in transporting rice and other essential commodities to interior villages.

"2011-11-20 13:49:20","Mizo National Front (MNF) is a regional political party in Mizoram, India. MNF emerged out of the Mizo National Famine Front, which was formed by Pu Laldenga to protest against the inaction of the Indian central government towards the famine situation in the Mizo areas of the Assam state in 1959. It staged a major uprising in 1966, followed by years of underground activities. In 1986, it signed the Mizo Accord with the Government of India, renouncing secession and violence. MNF suffered a strong incumbency wave in the 2008 Mizoram Election and lost all their MLA seats except three.


In 1959, Mizo Hills was devastated by a great famine known in Mizo history as 'Mautam' . The cause of the famine was attributed to flowering of bamboos which consequently resulted in rat population boom in large numbers. After eating up bamboos seeds, the rats turned towards crops and infested the huts and houses and became a plaque to the Villages. The havoc created by the rats was terrible and very little of the grain was harvested. For sustenance, many Mizos had to collect roots and leaves from the jungles while a considerable number died of starvation. Earlier in 1955, Mizo Cultural Society was formed and Laldenga was its Secretary. In March 1960, the name of the Mizo Cultural Society was changed to 'Mautam front'. During the famine of 1959-1960, this society took lead in demanding relief and managed to attract the attention of all sections of the people. In September 1960, the Society adopted the name Mizo National Famine Front (MNFF). The MNFF gained considerable popularity as a large number of Mizo Youth assisted in transporting rice and other essential commodities to interior villages.
The Mizo National Famine Front, which was originally formed to help ease the immense sufferings of the people during the severe Mautam Famine in Mizoram, was converted into Mizo National Front (MNF) on October 22, 1961. The ways in which the authority of the day handled the famine left the people disillusioned. The wave of secessionist and armed insurrection was running high among the Mizos. In 1966, MNF led a major uprising against the government, but failed to gain administrative control of the Mizo district. The secessionist movement held on for about two decades. During that time, they invaded Burma claiming chin state and Tahan belong to Mizoram since most of the resident in Tahan are Mizo.
This chapter of insurgency finally came to a close with the signing of the Mizoram Peace Accord on June 30, 1986 between the underground government of the Mizo National Front and the Government of India.

"2011-06-17 18:35:39","Mizo National Front (MNF) is a regional political party in Mizoram, India. MNF emerged out of the Mizo National Famine Front, which was formed by Pu Laldenga to protest against the inaction of the Indian central government towards the famine situation in the Mizo areas of the Assam state in 1959. It staged a major uprising in 1966, followed by years of underground activities. In 1986, it signed the Mizo Accord with the Government of India, renouncing secession and violence. MNF suffered a strong incumbency wave in the 2008 Mizoram Election and lost all their MLA seats except three.


In 1959, Mizo Hills was devastated by a great famine known in Mizo history as 'Mautam' . The cause of the famine was attributed to flowering of bamboos which consequently resulted in rat population boom in large numbers. After eating up bamboos seeds, the rats turned towards crops and infested the huts and houses and became a plaque to the Villages. The havoc created by the rats was terrible and very little of the grain was harvested. For sustenance, many Mizos had to collect roots and leaves from the jungles while a considerable number died of starvation. Earlier in 1955, Mizo Cultural Society was formed and Laldenga was its Secretary. In March 1960, the name of the Mizo Cultural Society was changed to 'Mautam front'. During the famine of 1959-1960, this society took lead in demanding relief and managed to attract the attention of all sections of the people. In September 1960, the Society adopted the name Mizo National Famine Front (MNFF). The MNFF gained considerable popularity as a large number of Mizo Youth assisted in transporting rice and other essential commodities to interior villages.
The Mizo National Famine Front, which was originally formed to help ease the immense sufferings of the people during the severe Mautam Famine in Mizoram, was converted into Mizo National Front (MNF) on October 22, 1961. The ways in which the authority of the day handled the famine left the people disillusioned. The wave of secessionist and armed insurrection was running high among the Mizos. In 1966, MNF led a major uprising against the government, but failed to gain administrative control of the Mizo district. The secessionist movement held on for about two decades. During that time, they invaded Burma claiming chin state and Tahan belong to Mizoram since most of the resident in Tahan are Mizo.
This chapter of insurgency finally came to a close with the signing of the Mizoram Peace Accord on June 30, 1986 between the underground government of the Mizo National Front and the Government of India. Under the terms of the peace accord, Mizoram was granted statehood in February 1987. Laldenga became Chief Minister, but soon lost power due to defections in the party.
Former guerrilla leader Pu Zoramthanga became party leader following the death of Laldenga in 1990. In 1998 and 2003 MNF won the state assembly elections, and Pu Zoramthanga was chief minister for 10 years. In the 2003 elections MNF won 21 out of 40 seats in the state assembly, and got 132 505 votes (31,66%). MNF was part of the National Democratic Alliance, but later withdrew in 2007[1].

In 1959, Mizo Hills was devastated by a great famine known in Mizo history as 'Mautam' . The cause of the famine was attributed to flowering of bamboos which consequent resulted in rat population boom in large numbers. After eating up bamboos seeds, the rats turned towards crops and infested the huts and houses and became a plaque to the Villages. The havoc created by the rats was terrible and very little of the grain was harvested. For sustenance, many Mizos had to collect roots and leaves from the jungles while a considerable number died of starvation. Earlier in 1955, Mizo Cultural Society was formed in 1955 and Laldenga was its Secretary. In March 1960, the name of the Mizo Cultural Society was changed to 'Mautam front' During the famine of 1959-1960, this society took lead in demanding relief and managed to attract the attention of all sections of the people. In September 1960, the Society adopted the name Mizo National Famine Front (MNFF). The MNFF gained considerable popularity as a large number of Mizo Youth assisted in transporting rice and other essential commodities to interior villages.
The Mizo National Famine Front, which was originally formed to help ease the immense sufferings of the people during the severe Mautam Famine in Mizoram, was converted into Mizo National Front (MNF) on October 22, 1961. The ways in which the authority of the day handled the famine left the people disillusioned. The wave of secessionist and armed insurrection was running high among the Mizos. The secessionist movement held on for about two decades. During that time, they invaded Burma claiming chin state and Tahan belong to Mizoram since most of the resident in Tahan are Mizo.
This chapter of insurgency finally came to a close with the signing of the Mizoram Peace Accord on June 30, 1986 between the underground government of the Mizo National Front and the Government of India. Under the terms of the peace accord, Mizoram was granted statehood in February 1987. Laldenga became Chief Minister, but soon lost power due to defections in the party.
Former guerrilla leader Pu Zoramthanga became party leader following the death of Laldenga in 1990. In 1998 and 2003 MNF won the state assembly elections, and Pu Zoramthanga was chief minister for 10 years. In the 2003 elections MNF won 21 out of 40 seats in the state assembly, and got 132 505 votes (31,66%). MNF was part of the National Democratic Alliance, but later withdrew in 2007[1]. Officers as of 2007 were: President: Pu Zoramthanga Vice President: Pu Tawnluia Treasurer: Pu Tlanghmingthanga
The MNF suffered a heavy defeat in the 2008 state assembly elections, winning only 3 of the 40 seats, and the Indian National Congress swept to power.
In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections MNF won the only seat of Mizoram. The MNF candidate Pu Vanlalzawma got 182 864 votes (52,46%). MNF abstained in the vote of confidence on 22 July 2008 to maintain distance from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and United Progressive Alliance.[citation needed]

In 1959, Mizo Hills was devastated by a great famine known in Mizo history as 'Mautam Famine' . The cause of the famine was attributed to flowering of bamboos which consequent resulted in rat population boom in large numbers. After eating up bamboos seeds, the rats turned towards crops and infested the huts and houses and became a plaque to the Villages. The havoc created by the rats was terrible and very little of the grain was harvested. For sustenance, many Mizos had to collect roots and leaves from the jungles while a considerable number died of starvation.

MNF emerged out of the Mizo Famine Front, which was formed by Pu Laldenga to protest against the inaction of the Indian central government towards the famine situation in the Mizo areas of the Assam state in 1959.


In 1959, Mizo Hills was devastated by a great famine known in Mizo history as 'Mautam Famine' . The cause of the famine was attributed to flowering of bamboos which consequent resulted in rat population boom in large numbers. After eating up bamboos seeds, the rats turned towards crops and infested the huts and houses and became a plaque to the Villages. The havoc created by the rats was terrible and very little of the grain was harvested. For sustenance, many Mizos had to collect roots and leaves from the jungles while a considerable number died of starvation. Earlier in 1955, Mizo Cultural Society was formed in 1955 and Laldenga was its Secretary. In March 1960, the name of the Mizo Cultural Society was changed to 'Mautam front' During the famine of 1959-1960, this society took lead in demanding relief and managed to attract the attention of all sections of the people. In September 1960, the Society adopted the name of Mizo National Famine Front (MNFF). The MNFF gained considerable popularity as a large number of Mizo Youth assisted in transporting rice and other essential commodities to interior villages.
The Mizo National Famine Front, which was originally formed to help ease the immense sufferings of the people during the severe Mautam Famine in Mizoram, was converted into Mizo National Front (MNF) on October 22, 1961. The ways in which the authority of the day handled the famine left the people disillusioned. The wave of secessionist and armed insurrection was running high among the Mizos. The MNF Party took the ultimate step of declaring Mizoram a sovereign and independent state with effect from the midnight of February 28, 1966. The secessionist movement held on for about two decades.
This chapter of insurgency finally came to a close with the signing of the Memorandum of Settlement on June 30, 1986 between the underground government of the Mizo National Front and the Government of India with Pu Laldenga became Chief Minister.
Former guerrilla leader Pu Zoramthanga became party leader following the death of Laldenga in 1990. In 1998 and 2003 MNF won the state assembly elections, and Pu Zoramthanga is currently chief minister. In the 2003 elections MNF won 21 out of 40 seats in the state assembly, and got 132 505 votes (31,66%). MNF was part of the National Democratic Alliance but later withdrew in 2007[1].

The MNFF gained considerable popularity as a large number of Mizo Youth assisted in transporting rice and other essential commodities to interior villages.
The Mizo National Famine Front, which was originally formed to help ease the immense sufferings of the people during the severe Mautam Famine in Mizoram, was converted into a political party --- The Mizo National Front (MNF) on October 22, 1961. The pathetic ways in which the authority of the day handled the famine left the people disillusioned. The wave of secessionism and armed insurrection was running high among the Mizos. The MNF Party took the ultimate step of declaring Mizoram a sovereign and independent state with effect from the midnight of February 28, 1966. Thus began a new chapter in the annals of Mizoram history, a chapter of untold misery, violence and death. The people held on to the ideas of political and economic independence against all odds for about two decades.
This chapter of insurgency finally came to a close with the signing of the Memorundum of Settlement on June 30, 1986 between the erstwhile underground government of the Mizo National Front and the Government of India. The era of violence was replaced by peace and harmony, the people merged with mainstream India, and the spirit of secessionism and regionalism were replaced by Indian nationalism.
In 1986 a peace agreement was signed between the government of India and MNF. Mizoram was created as a separate state within India, and Pu Laldenga became Chief Minister. However in 1989, MNF lost the first elections following the peace agreement.
Former guerrilla leader Pu Zoramthanga became party leader following the death of Laldenga in 1990.
