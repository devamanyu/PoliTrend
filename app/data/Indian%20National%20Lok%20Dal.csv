The Election Symbol of the Indian National Lok Dal, as approved by the Election Commission of India, is the “spectacles” (or chashma in Hindi). This is a significant political symbol for a party that claims to work for the poor people. The INLD claims to be the voice of the farmers, peasants and the oppressed sections of the society. In the states where it has a visible presence, the INLD follows the Gandhian ideals of non-violent resistance and democratic dissent. The INLD also claims to have rescued the state of Haryana from sheer lawlessness in 1999, when Chautala came to power and solved the crisis in the state.
The “spectacle” symbol is symbolic as it indicates the power of the Indian National Lok Dal to see the downcast state of living of the peasants and farmers in Haryana and Rajasthan. Devi Lal, who took major decisions for the party when he was alive, was respected by the people for his capability to see and feel the conditions of the people for whom he fought. His major schemes and policies as Chief Minister, followed by his son, have had a vibrant impact in the whole of the state of Haryana. Om Prakash's vision is to see India as a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic Republic. Thus, the INLD election symbol speaks for itself.
As a regional political party, the Indian National Lok Dal has had a number of significant achievements. Some of them are listed below:

Om Parkash Chautala is currently the Leader of Opposition in Haryana, since 2005.
INLD has lost all the four consecutive general elections held since 2000.[2] It lost two assembly elections for Haryana in 2005 & 2009. It failed to win any seats in Lok Sabha in 2004 and 2009 general elections, despite being in alliance with Bharatiya Janata Party in 2009, and it was able to secure only 10.64 per cent votes(2009).[3] In 2004, the party contested on 20 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Chandigarh, but 14 of those lost their deposits.

Later INLD broke its alliance with the BJP, and left NDA and the government.
However, in the 2005 Haryana state assembly elections, INLD lost its majority, winning just 9 out of the 90 seats compared to the Congress party's 67 seats. 17 of its candidates lost deposits, but despite this, INLD managed to secure 26.77 per cent votes in this election.[5] In 2009, the INLD led alliance sprung up a surprise by winning 32 seats (INLD won 31 & its ally SAD won a seat)[6] Despite all defeat, INLD is considered a leading political party.
However, the party has gained some ground recently. After losing all the seats it contested in 2009 Lok Sabha elections, it surprisingly won 30 seats in 2009 Haryana Legislative Assembly elections held months later.

"2014-10-07 10:42:08","Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), a political party in India, in the state of Haryana is the principal opposition party in Haryana. INLD was founded by Choudhary Devi Lal, who served as Deputy Prime Minister of India in V.P. Singh Cabinet and Chief Minister of Haryana in two small stints. His son Om Prakash Chautala is the current president & Chautala's elder son Ajay Singh Chautala is the current Secretary General. The party was a member of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and thus part of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government (1998-2004) at the Federal level. Om Parkash Chautala is currently the Leader of Opposition in Haryana, since 2005.
INLD has lost all the four consecutive general elections held since 2000.[2] It lost two assembly elections for Haryana in 2005 & 2009. It failed to win any seats in Lok Sabha in 2004 and 2009 general elections, despite being in alliance with Bharatiya Janata Party in 2009, and it was able to secure only 10.64 per cent votes(2009).[3] In 2004, the party contested on 20 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Chandigarh, but 14 of those lost their deposits. Its 10 candidates in Haryana secured 22.43 per cent votes, 5 candidates secured 0.52 per cent votes in Rajasthan, 4 candidates secured 0.02 per cent votes in Uttar Pradesh and its lone candidate UT secured 6.61 per cent votes in Chandigarh.[4]
In the Lok Sabha elections 1999, INLD had an electoral alliance with BJP in Haryana. Each party contested five of the ten seats in the state. All ten were elected. In 2000 Chautala was elected as the Chief Minister of Haryana for the fifth time. In the 2000 state assembly elections, INLD won 47 out of the 90 seats (the party had 62 candidates in total). Later INLD broke its alliance with the BJP, and left NDA and the government.
However, in the 2005 Haryana state assembly elections, INLD lost its majority, winning just 9 out of the 90 seats compared to the Congress party's 67 seats. 17 of its candidates lost deposits, but despite this, INLD managed to secure 26.77 per cent votes in this election.[5] In 2009, the INLD led alliance sprung up a surprise by winning 32 seats (INLD won 31 & its ally SAD won a seat)[6] Despite all defeat, INLD is considered a leading political party.
However, the party has gained some ground recently. After losing all the seats it contested in 2009 Lok Sabha elections, it surprisingly won 30 seats in 2009 Haryana Legislative Assembly elections held months later. This reduced the ruling Congress government to a minority (Congress was expected to gain a comfortable majority). Also, in 2014 General Elections to the Lok Sabha, where they won 2 seats (They had not had any members previous two Lok Sabhas).

However, an even stronger resurgence of Bharatiya Janata Party (which fought in alliance with Kuldeep Bishnoi-led Haryana Janahit Congress (HJC)) has eclipsed this.


On August 10, 2013 INLD leader Abhay Chautala said that his party would not forge an alliance with the BJP for forthcoming general elections, even if Kuldeep Bishnoi-led Haryana Janhit Congress merged with the BJP party. However, he did state that the INLD would support Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi ""unconditionally"" for the Prime Minister post, if required and would make all the effort to overthrow Congress and hence, would welcome any political party who'd wish to join its campaign.
The INLD state president Ashok Arora stated that Haryana Janhit Congress had no base in Haryana and its leader Kuldeep Bishnoi would not win the Hisar parliamentary seat in the coming Lok Sabha elections.
In June 2008 Chautala and 53 others were charged in connection with the appointment of 3,206 junior basic teachers in the state of Haryana during 1999-2000.In January 2013 a New Delhi court sentenced Chautala and his son Ajay Singh Chautala to ten years imprisonment under various provisions of the IPC and the Prevention of Corruption Act.[7] Chautala was found guilty of illegally recruiting over 3000 teachers.[8] A CBI investigation was ordered by the Supreme Court during NDA regime led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee.[9][10]
On 11 July 2014 the New Delhi High court reserved its verdict in regards to the appeal by Chautala.[11]

However, in the 2005 Haryana state assembly elections, INLD lost its majority, winning just 9 out of the 90 seats compared to the Congress party's 67 seats. 17 of its candidates lost deposits, but despite this, INLD managed to secure 26.77 per cent votes in this election.[5] In 2009, the INLD led alliance sprung up a surprise by winning 32 seats (INLD won 31 & its ally SAD won a seat), but its vote share got reduced to 26.5 per cent and 24 INLD candidates lost their deposit.[6] Despite all defeat, INLD is considered a leading political party.
However, the party has gained some ground recently. After losing all the seats it contested in 2009 Lok Sabha elections, it surprisingly won 30 seats in 2009 Haryana Legislative Assembly elections held months later. This reduced the ruling Congress government to a minority (Congress was expected to gain a comfortable majority). Also, in 2014 General Elections to the Lok Sabha, where they won 2 seats (They had not had any members previous two Lok Sabhas). However, an even stronger resurgence of Bharatiya Janata Party (which fought in alliance with Kuldeep Bishnoi-led Haryana Janahit Congress (HJC)) has eclipsed this.


On August 10, 2013 INLD leader Abhay Chautala said that his party would not forge an alliance with the BJP for forthcoming general elections, even if Kuldeep Bishnoi-led Haryana Janhit Congress merged with the BJP party. However, he did state that the INLD would support Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi ""unconditionally"" for the Prime Minister post, if required and would make all the effort to overthrow Congress and hence, would welcome any political party who'd wish to join its campaign.
The INLD state president Ashok Arora stated that Haryana Janhit Congress had no base in Haryana and its leader Kuldeep Bishnoi would not win the Hisar parliamentary seat in the coming Lok Sabha elections.
Many Controversies have been associated with INLD leaders since the beginning of its political career.[7]
INLD leader Om Parkash Chautala was publicly disowned by his father Devi Lal. He had allegedly smuggled gold watches worth Rs 100,000. Even his sons had been accused of being involved in controversies.[8]
Meham was perhaps INLD's biggest political controversy, which brought him national attention. The shadow of Meham was to dog OP Chautala right up to 1996, when Justice Commission K.N. Saikia indicted him as an accessory after the fact, in the killing of Amir Singh.[9]
INLD president OP Chautala has been accused of protecting the then Director General of Police, SPS Rathore in the Ruchika Girhotra child molestation case. The matter, as of now, is sub-judice.[10]
Indicting the former Chief Minister, his two sons, Abhay and Ajay, and their wives for amassing disproportionate assets worth Rs 1,467 crore, the CBI has filed a chargesheet in a the Delhi Court. The CBI has submitted that Om Prakash Chautala and his family acquired more than 80 properties in different parts of India between 1993 and 2006.[11]
Om Parkash Chautala, Ajay Chautala and its former state president Sher Singh Barshyami has been convicted in the much publicised JBT Scam. All the 55 accused has been sent to judicial custody. The judgement will be announced on 22 January 2013. The CBI had filed a Chargesheet, in which it is recorded that in the year 1999–2000, 3032 teachers were recruited by the former CM and his son Ajay Chautala along with the other accused on the basis of forged documents. The matter was registered by the CBI on the direction of the Supreme Court and the CBI seized documents and properties in lakhs from various places.[12]
Chautalas are all set to face fresh trouble as the CBI has recommended registration of cases of cheating, forgery and conspiracy against him and several top officers, including two former chief secretaries, in the HCS nomination recruitment scandal.[13][14] He has been accused of changing of criteria several times, awarding higher marks to candidates in interviews, dropping the vigilance and departmental inquiries against favoured candidates, tampering with and ignoring the deserving candidates’ records. This was how candidates were recruited for the Haryana Civil Services (Executive) in 2004, revealed CBI.a [15]
Om Parkash Chautala & his family is accused by their opponents to amass wealth using the official position.[16] He was presented numerous costly presents including crowns ans Gold Brick.[17]

Both the president Om Prakash Chautala and his son and Secretary General Ajay Singh Chautala in 2013 were convicted by a Delhi court of fraud and bribery during their stint in the state Government in Haryana (2000-2005), and as of May 2014, are in prison. INLD has lost all the four consecutive general elections held since 2000.[2] It lost two assembly elections for Haryana in 2005 & 2009. It failed to win any seats in Lok Sabha in 2004 and 2009 general elections, despite being in alliance with Bharatiya Janata Party in 2009, and it was able to secure only 10.64 per cent votes(2009).[3] In 2004, the party contested on 20 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Chandigarh, but 14 of those lost their deposits. Its 10 candidates in Haryana secured 22.43 per cent votes, 5 candidates secured 0.52 per cent votes in Rajasthan, 4 candidates secured 0.02 per cent votes in Uttar Pradesh and its lone candidate UT secured 6.61 per cent votes in Chandigarh.[4]
In the Lok Sabha elections 1999, INLD had an electoral alliance with BJP in Haryana. Each party contested five of the ten seats in the state. All ten were elected. In 2000 Chautala was elected as the Chief Minister of Haryana for the fifth time. In the 2000 state assembly elections, INLD won 47 out of the 90 seats (the party had 62 candidates in total). Later INLD broke its alliance with the BJP, and left NDA and the government.
However, in the 2005 Haryana state assembly elections, INLD lost its majority, winning just 9 out of the 90 seats compared to the Congress party's 67 seats. 17 of its candidates lost deposits, but despite this, INLD managed to secure 26.77 per cent votes in this election.[5] In 2009, the INLD led alliance sprung up a surprise by winning 32 seats (INLD won 31 & its ally SAD won a seat), but its vote share got reduced to 26.5 per cent and 24 INLD candidates lost their deposit.[6] Despite all defeat, INLD is considered a leading political party.
However, the party has gained some ground recently. After losing all the seats it contested in 2009 Lok Sabha elections, it surprisingly won 30 seats in 2009 Haryana Legislative Assembly elections held months later. This reduced the ruling Congress government to a minority (Congress was expected to gain a comfortable majority). Also, in 2014 General Elections to the Lok Sabha, where they won 2 seats (They had not had any members previous two Lok Sabhas). However, an even stronger resurgence of Bharatiya Janata Party (which fought in alliance with Kuldeep Bishnoi-led Haryana Janahit Congress (HJC)) has eclipsed this.
On August 10, 2013 INLD leader Abhay Chautala said that his party would not forge an alliance with the BJP for forthcoming general elections, even if Kuldeep Bishnoi-led Haryana Janhit Congress merged with the BJP party. However, he did state that the INLD would support Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi ""unconditionally"" for the Prime Minister post, if required and would make all the effort to overthrow Congress and hence, would welcome any political party who'd wish to join its campaign.
The INLD state president Ashok Arora stated that Haryana Janhit Congress had no base in Haryana and its leader Kuldeep Bishnoi would not win the Hisar parliamentary seat in the coming Lok Sabha elections.

Its 10 candidates in Haryana secured 22.43 per cent votes, 5 candidates secured 0.52 per cent votes in Rajasthan, 4 candidates secured 0.02 per cent votes in Uttar Pradesh and its lone candidate UT secured 6.61 per cent votes in Chandigarh.[3]
In the Lok Sabha elections 1999, INLD had an electoral alliance with BJP in Haryana. Each party contested five of the ten seats in the state. All ten were elected. In 2000 Chautala was elected as the Chief Minister of Haryana for the fifth time. In the 2000 state assembly elections, INLD won 47 out of the 90 seats (the party had 62 candidates in total). Later INLD broke its alliance with the BJP, and left NDA and the government.
However, in the 2005 Haryana state assembly elections, INLD lost its majority, winning just 9 out of the 90 seats compared to the Congress party's 67 seats. 17 of its candidates lost deposits, but despite this, INLD managed to secure 26.77 per cent votes in this election.[4] In 2009, the INLD led alliance sprung up a surprise by winning 32 seats (INLD won 31 & its ally SAD won a seat), but its vote share got reduced to 26.5 per cent and 24 INLD candidates lost their deposit.[5] Despite all defeat, INLD is considered a leading political party.
However, the party has gained some ground recently. After losing all the seats it contested in 2009 Lok Sabha elections, it surprisingly won 30 seats in 2009 Haryana Legislative Assembly elections held months later. This reduced the ruling Congress government to a minority (Congress was expected to gain a comfortable majority). Also, in 2014 General Elections to the Lok Sabha, where they won 2 seats (They had not had any members previous two Lok Sabhas). However, an even stronger resurgence of Bharatiya Janata Party (which fought in alliance with Kuldeep Bishnoi-led Haryana Janahit Congress (HJC)) has eclipsed this.
On August 10, 2013 INLD leader Abhay Chautala said that his party would not forge an alliance with the BJP for forthcoming general elections, even if Kuldeep Bishnoi-led Haryana Janhit Congress merged with the BJP party. However, he did state that the INLD would support Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi ""unconditionally"" for the Prime Minister post, if required and would make all the effort to overthrow Congress and hence, would welcome any political party who'd wish to join its campaign.
The INLD state president Ashok Arora stated that Haryana Janhit Congress had no base in Haryana and its leader Kuldeep Bishnoi would not win the Hisar parliamentary seat in the coming Lok Sabha elections.

"2014-05-29 13:46:15","Indian National Lok Dal(INLD), a political party in India, in the state of Haryana is the principal opposition party in Haryana. INLD was founded by Choudhary Devi Lal, who served as Deputy Prime Minister of India in V.P. Singh Cabinet and Chief Minister of Haryana in two small stints. His son Om Prakash Chautala is the current president & Chautala's elder son Ajay Singh Chautala is the current Secretary General. The party was a member of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and thus part of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government (1998-2004) at the Federal level. Om Parkash Chautala is currently the Leader of Opposition in Haryana, since 2005. In Rajasthan, Choudhary Jai Narayan Poonia (ex-cabinet minister) was the Chairman of the INLD party from 2003 to 2008.
Since the demise of Devi Lal in April 2001, INLD had faced political decline, and its leaders have been marred by corruption scandals. Both the president Om Prakash Chautala and his son and Secretary General Ajay Singh Chautala in 2013 were convicted by a Delhi court of fraud and bribery during their stint in the state Government in Haryana (2000-2005), and as of May 2014, are in prison.

Its leader Om Parkash Chautala is also Leader of Opposition in Haryana. In Rajasthan, Choudhary Jai Narayan Poonia (ex-cabinat minister) was the Chairman of the INLD party from 2003 to 2008.
Since the demise of Devi Lal in April 2001, INLD had faced political decline and lost all the four consecutive general elections held so far in Haryana.[1] It lost two assembly general elections in 2005 & 2009. It has not won a single Lok Sabha seat since 1999 and further lost all seats in 2004 & 2009. In 2009, the INLD party lost on all seats despite its poll alliance with the BJP. It was able to secure only 10.64 per cent votes.[2] INLD has always cherished national dreams. In 2004, the party contested on 20 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Chandigarh, but 14 of those could not secure their deposits and lost. Its 10 candidates in Haryana secured 22.43 per cent votes, 5 candidates secured 0.52 per cent votes in Rajasthan, 4 candidates secured 0.02 per cent votes in Uttar Pradesh and its lone candidate UT secured 6.61 per cent votes in Chandigarh.[3]
In the Lok Sabha elections 1999, INLD had an electoral alliance with BJP in Haryana. Each party contested five of the ten seats in the state. All ten were elected. In 2000 Chautala was elected as the Chief Minister of Haryana for the fifth time. In the 2000 state assembly elections, INLD won 47 out of the 90 seats (the party had 62 candidates in total). Later INLD broke its alliance with the BJP, and left NDA and the government.
However, in the 2005 Haryana state assembly elections, INLD lost its majority, winning just 9 out of the 90 seats compared to the Congress party's 67 seats. 17 of its candidates lost deposits, but despite this, INLD managed to secure 26.77 per cent votes in this election.[4] In 2009, the INLD led alliance sprung up a surprise by winning 32 seats (INLD won 31 & its ally SAD won a seat), but its vote share got reduced to 26.5 per cent and 24 INLD candidates lost their deposit.[5] Despite all defeat, INLD is considered a leading political party.


On Saturday, August 10, 2013 INLD leader Abhay Chautala said that his party would not forge an alliance with the BJP for forthcoming general elections, even if Kuldeep Bishnoi-led Haryana Janhit Congress merged with the BJP party. However, he did state that the INLD would support Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi ""unconditionally"" for the Prime Minister post, if required and would make all the effort to overthrow Congress and hence, would welcome any political party who'd wish to join its campaign.
Chautala accused Congress of misusing the CBI against INLD Chief Om Prakash Chautala, as he had opposed the alleged illegal allotment of land in Haryana to Robert Vadra, Congress President Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law. He claimed that the INLD chief was targeted because he had announced that a high-level inquiry would be initiated in this matter, if INLD came to power. During the party workers meeting in Matherishekhan village, Chautala indicted the state government of unlawfully acquiring land of farmers for setting up SEZ only to offer it to builders.
The INLD state president Ashok Arora stated that Haryana Janhit Congress had no base in Haryana and its leader Kuldeep Bishnoi would not win the Hisar parliamentary seat in the coming Lok Sabha elections. Chautala further stated that the INLD will demand that the number of hearings in the Assembly session be increased from two to permit the opposition party to raise their concerns. Leaders of the INLD also announced that they will raise crucial issues on water crisis, the worsening condition of law and order, land scams, DLF-Vadra land deal and Rajiv Gandhi Trust land scam in the state including non-availability of books in schools and iron tablets, among others.[6]
Many Controversies have been associated with INLD leaders since the beginning of its political career.[7]
INLD leader Om Parkash Chautala was publicly disowned by his father Devi Lal. He had allegedly smuggled gold watches worth Rs 100,000. Even his sons had been accused of being involved in controversies.[8]
Meham was perhaps INLD's biggest political controversy, which brought him national attention. The shadow of Meham was to dog OP Chautala right up to 1996, when Justice Commission K.N. Saikia indicted him as an accessory after the fact, in the killing of Amir Singh.[9]
INLD president OP Chautala has been accused of protecting the then Director General of Police, SPS Rathore in the Ruchika Girhotra child molestation case. The matter, as of now, is sub-judice.[10]
Indicting the former Chief Minister, his two sons, Abhay and Ajay, and their wives for amassing disproportionate assets worth Rs 1,467 crore, the CBI has filed a chargesheet in a the Delhi Court. The CBI has submitted that Om Prakash Chautala and his family acquired more than 80 properties in different parts of India between 1993 and 2006.[11]
Om Parkash Chautala, Ajay Chautala and its former state president Sher Singh Barshyami has been convicted in the much publicised JBT Scam. All the 55 accused has been sent to judicial custody. The judgement will be announced on 22 January 2013. The CBI had filed a Chargesheet, in which it is recorded that in the year 1999–2000, 3032 teachers were recruited by the former CM and his son Ajay Chautala along with the other accused on the basis of forged documents. The matter was registered by the CBI on the direction of the Supreme Court and the CBI seized documents and properties in lakhs from various places.[12]
Chautalas are all set to face fresh trouble as the CBI has recommended registration of cases of cheating, forgery and conspiracy against him and several top officers, including two former chief secretaries, in the HCS nomination recruitment scandal.[13][14] He has been accused of changing of criteria several times, awarding higher marks to candidates in interviews, dropping the vigilance and departmental inquiries against favoured candidates, tampering with and ignoring the deserving candidates’ records. This was how candidates were recruited for the Haryana Civil Services (Executive) in 2004, revealed CBI.a [15]
Om Parkash Chautala & his family is accused by their opponents to amass wealth using the official position.[16] He was presented numerous costly presents including crowns ans Gold Brick.[17]

INLD is a family based party with Om Prakash Chautala being the president & his elder son Ajay Singh Chautala being its Secretary General. The party was a member of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and thus part of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government. Its leader Om Parkash Chautala is also Leader of Opposition in Haryana. In Rajasthan, Choudhary Jai Narayan Poonia (ex-cabinat minister) was the Chairman of the INLD party from 2003 to 2008.
Since the demise of Devi Lal in April 2001, INLD had faced political decline and lost all the four consecutive general elections held so far in Haryana.[1] It lost two assembly general elections in 2005 & 2009. It has not won a single Lok Sabha seat since 1999 and further lost all seats in 2004 & 2009. In 2009, the INLD party lost on all seats despite its poll alliance with the BJP. It was able to secure only 10.64 per cent votes.[2] INLD has always cherished national dreams. In 2004, the party contested on 20 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Chandigarh, but 14 of those could not secure their deposits and lost. Its 10 candidates in Haryana secured 22.43 per cent votes, 5 candidates secured 0.52 per cent votes in Rajasthan, 4 candidates secured 0.02 per cent votes in Uttar Pradesh and its lone candidate UT secured 6.61 per cent votes in Chandigarh.[3]
In the Lok Sabha elections 1999, INLD had an electoral alliance with BJP in Haryana. Each party contested five of the ten seats in the state. All ten were elected. In 2000 Chautala was elected as the Chief Minister of Haryana for the fifth time. In the 2000 state assembly elections, INLD won 47 out of the 90 seats (the party had 62 candidates in total). Later INLD broke its alliance with the BJP, and left NDA and the government.
However, in the 2005 Haryana state assembly elections, INLD lost its majority, winning just 9 out of the 90 seats compared to the Congress party's 67 seats. 17 of its candidates lost deposits, but despite this, INLD managed to secure 26.77 per cent votes in this election.[4] In 2009, the INLD led alliance sprung up a surprise by winning 32 seats (INLD won 31 & its ally SAD won a seat), but its vote share got reduced to 26.5 per cent and 24 INLD candidates lost their deposit.[5] Despite all defeat, INLD is considered a leading political party.


On Saturday, August 10, 2013 INLD leader Abhay Chautala said that his party would not forge an alliance with the BJP for forthcoming general elections, even if Kuldeep Bishnoi-led Haryana Janhit Congress merged with the BJP party. However, he did state that the INLD would support Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi ""unconditionally"" for the Prime Minister post, if required and would make all the effort to overthrow Congress from power and hence, would welcome any political party who'd wish to join its campaign.
Chautala accused Congress of misusing the CBI against INLD Chief Om Parkash Chautala, as he had opposed the alleged illegal allotment of land in Haryana to Robert Vadra, Congress President Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law. He claimed that the INLD chief was targeted because he had announced that a high-level inquiry would be initiated in this matter, if INLD came to power. During the party workers meeting in Matherishekhan village, Chautala indicted the state government of unlawfully acquiring land of farmers for setting up SEZ only to offer it to builders.
The INLD state president Ashok Arora stated that Haryana Janhit Congress had no base in Haryana and its leader Kuldeep Bishnoi would not win the Hisar parliamentary seat in the coming Lok Sabha elections. Chautala further stated that the INLD will demand that the number of hearings in the Assembly session be increased from two to permit the opposition party to raise their concerns. Leaders of the INLD also announced that they will raise crucial issues on water crisis, the worsening condition of law and order, land scams, DLF-Vadra land deal and Rajiv Gandhi Trust land scam in the state including non-availability of books in schools and iron tablets, among others [6].
Many Controversies have been associated with INLD leaders since the beginning of its political career.[7]
INLD leader Om Parkash Chautala was publicly disowned by his father Devi Lal. He had allegedly smuggled gold watches worth Rs 100,000. Even his sons had been accused of being involved in controversies.[8]
Meham was perhaps INLD's biggest political controversy, which brought him national attention. The shadow of Meham was to dog OP Chautala right up to 1996, when Justice Commission K.N. Saikia indicted him as an accessory after the fact, in the killing of Amir Singh.[9]
INLD president OP Chautala has been accused of protecting the then Director General of Police, SPS Rathore in the Ruchika Girhotra child molestation case. The matter, as of now, is sub-judice.[10]
Indicting the former Chief Minister, his two sons, Abhay and Ajay, and their wives for amassing disproportionate assets worth Rs 1,467 crore, the CBI has filed a chargesheet in a the Delhi Court. The CBI has submitted that Om Prakash Chautala and his family acquired more than 80 properties in different parts of India between 1993 and 2006.[11]

INLD is dedicated to the all-round uplift of farmers, labourers, rural and urban areas and the downtrodden and exploited. It draws inspiration from Gandhian principles, our rich heritage and the noble traditions of our struggle for national independence. The party considers the right of peaceful and democratic dissent including Satyagrah or non-violent resistance as a fundamental right of the people. [2]
In very testing times INLD assumed office on July 24, 1999. During 1991-96, the Congress Government had 37 ministers and on 16 occasions the portfolios of the Ministers had to be changed.
The Congress Government was followed by HVP-BJP government. It had 44 members in the Assembly; of them 43 were either ministers or holding some other office. The misrule had led to near bankruptcy in the State. The INLD Government with Chaudhary Om Prakash Chautala not only provided political stability but also gave efficient administration resulting in a surplus of Rs. 1750 crore at the time of handing over reins of power to Congress.
During this period, law and order was established and rural and urban areas made safe and secure. The economic activity was boosted all over the State because of this.
The next priority was boosting power generation, strengthening transmission and making equitable distribution. As a first step 802 MW capacity was increased during the first three years and more than 45 thousand tube well connections were released. New sub-stations were commissioned
Yamunanagar Thermal Power Plant had remained in the planning stage for more than twenty years. This was finally given shape in 2004 when for beginning the work contract was finalized and signed.
The 7th unit of Tau Devi Lal Thermal plant, Panipat was dedicated to the people by the then President of India, Dr. APJ Kalam.
Dadupur Nalvi canal project too had been gathering dust. The cobwebs were cleared and the construction work begun.
For efficient irrigation, canals were lined and cleared of blockages.
In rural areas, the village link roads were strengthened, the lanes and bye lanes of villages paved and chaupals and dharamshalas repaired. Through the Sarakar Aapke Dwar programme about 45 thousand development works were undertaken.
In urban areas more than Rs. 1,295 crore were spent on sewerage and drinking water.
In order to wean away the students from inimical influences, the capacity of Engineering and Technical institutes was raised to 27,312 seats. 1172 schools were upgraded and English made compulsory from the first class.
In order to encourage girl students to continue their school study, they were given bicycles to go to school.
New roads of 6,429 kilometers were laid and 22,000 kilometers repaired. The farmers were given the highest sugar cane price in the country and two new sugar mills established.
Every grain of wheat, paddy and maize was purchased by the State and their remuneration given to the farmers immediately.
More than 2 lakh jobs were created for the youth of Haryana.
The crowning glory of the INLD, as in the past, was innovative schemes for the welfare of the people. Devi Rakshak Insurance scheme proved to be a landmark in social security and its variations are today adopted by many other States. Old age pensions and unemployment allowances were raised according to the rising prices.
In administration, bold steps were taken and INLD provided the lead to the whole country in the matter of introducing the VAT system. Highway patrolling was another innovative step that was followed by others. The fiscal acumen of the State was acknowledged by the Finance Commission as well as the Finance Minister of the UPA Government.
In 2004 ex-Chief Minister of Haryana, Mr Om Prakash Chautala, introduced a new system to redress the grievances of the people by holding day-long meetings at a single point in each Assembly constituency.[3]
Since the demise of Devi Lal in April 2001, INLD had faced political decline and lost all the four consecutive general elections held so far in Haryana.[4] It lost two assembly general elections in 2005 & 2009. It has not won a single Lok Sabha seat since 1999 as it lost on all seats in 2004 & 2009.

Many Controversies have been associated with INLD leaders since the beginning of his political career.[6]
INLD leader Om Parkash Chautala was publicly disowned by his father Devi Lal. He had allegedly smuggled gold watches worth Rs 100,000. Even his sons had been accused of being involved in controversies.[7]
Meham was perhaps INLD biggest political controversy, which brought him into national attention. The shadow of Meham was to dog OP Chautala right up to 1996, when the Justice K.N. Saikia Commission indicted him as an accessory after the fact in the killing of Amir Singh.[8]
INLD president OP Chautala has been accused of protecting the then Director General of Police, SPS Rathore in the Ruchika Girhotra child molestation case. The matter, as of now, is sub-judice.[9]
Indicting the former Chief Minister, his two sons, Abhay and Ajay, and their wives for amassing disproportionate assets worth Rs 1,467 crore, the CBI has filed a chargesheet in a Delhi Court. The CBI has submitted that Om Prakash Chautala and his family acquired more than 80 properties in different parts of India from 1993 to 2006.[10]
Om Prakash Chautala, Ajay Chautala and its former state president Sher Singh Barshyami has been convicted in the much publicised JBT Scam. All the 55 accused has been sent to judicial custody. The judgement will be announced on 22 January, 2013. The CBI had filed Chargesheet, as per which in the year 1999–2000, 3032 teachers were recruited by the former CM and his son Ajay Chautala along with the other accused on the basis of forged documents. The matter was registered by the CBI on the direction of the Supreme Court and the CBI seized documents and properties in lakhs from various places.[11]
Chautalas are all set to face fresh trouble as the CBI has recommended registration of cases of cheating, forgery and conspiracy against him and several top officers, including two former chief secretaries, in the HCS nomination recruitment scandal.[12][13] He has been accused of changing of criteria several times, awarding higher marks to candidates in interviews, dropping the vigilance and departmental inquiries against favoured candidates, tampering with and ignoring the deserving candidates’ records. This was how candidates were recruited for the Haryana Civil Services (Executive) in 2004, revealed CBI.a [14]

Many Controversies have been associated with INLD leaders since the beginning of his political career.[6]
INLD leader Om Parkash Chautala was publicly disowned by his father Devi Lal. He had allegedly smuggled gold watches worth Rs 100,000. Even his sons had been accused of being involved in controversies.[7]
Meham was perhaps INLD biggest political controversy, which brought him into national attention. The shadow of Meham was to dog OP Chautala right up to 1996, when the Justice K.N. Saikia Commission indicted him as an accessory after the fact in the killing of Amir Singh.[8]
INLD president OP Chautala has been accused of protecting the then Director General of Police, SPS Rathore in the Ruchika Girhotra child molestation case. The matter, as of now, is sub-judice.[9]
Indicting the former Chief Minister, his two sons, Abhay and Ajay, and their wives for amassing disproportionate assets worth Rs 1,467 crore, the CBI has filed a chargesheet in a Delhi Court. The CBI has submitted that Om Prakash Chautala and his family acquired more than 80 properties in different parts of India from 1993 to 2006.[10]
Om Prakash Chautala, Ajay Chautala and its former state president Sher Singh Barshyami has been convicted in the much publicised JBT Scam. All the 55 accused has been sent to judicial custody.

The matter was registered by the CBI on the direction of the Supreme Court and the CBI seized documents and properties in lakhs from various places.[11]
Chautalas are all set to face fresh trouble as the CBI has recommended registration of cases of cheating, forgery and conspiracy against him and several top officers, including two former chief secretaries, in the HCS nomination recruitment scandal.[12][13] He has been accused of changing of criteria several times, awarding higher marks to candidates in interviews, dropping the vigilance and departmental inquiries against favoured candidates, tampering with and ignoring the deserving candidates’ records. This was how candidates were recruited for the Haryana Civil Services (Executive) in 2004, revealed CBI.a [14]
Om Parkash Chautala & his family is accused by their opponents to amass wealth using the official position.[15] He was presented numerous costly presents including crowns ans Gold Brick.[16]

INLD president OP Chautala has been accused of protecting the then Director General of Police, SPS Rathore in the Ruchika Girhotra child molestation case. The matter, as of now, is sub-judice.[10]
Indicting the former Chief Minister, his two sons, Abhay and Ajay, and their wives for amassing disproportionate assets worth Rs 1,467 crore, the CBI has filed a chargesheet in a Delhi Court. The CBI has submitted that Om Prakash Chautala and his family acquired more than 80 properties in different parts of India from 1993 to 2006.[11]
Om Parkash Chautala is also accused in number of other cases including the much publicised JBT Scam.

The matter was registered by the CBI on the direction of the Supreme Court and the CBI seized documents and properties in lakhs from various places.[12]
Chautalas are all set to face fresh trouble as the CBI has recommended registration of cases of cheating, forgery and conspiracy against him and several top officers, including two former chief secretaries, in the HCS nomination recruitment scandal.[13][14] He has been accused of changing of criteria several times, awarding higher marks to candidates in interviews, dropping the vigilance and departmental inquiries against favoured candidates, tampering with and ignoring the deserving candidates’ records.

However, in the 2005 Haryana state assembly elections, INLD lost its majority, winning just 9 out of the 90 seats compared to the Congress party's 67 seats. 17 of its candidates lost deposits and despite all that INLD got 26.77 per cent votes in that election [5]. In 2009, the INLD led alliance sprung up a surprise by winning 32 seats (INLD won 31 & its ally SAD won one seat), but its vote share got reduced to 26.5 per cent and 24 INLD candidates lost deposit[6]. Despite all the defeats, INLD is considered a leading political party . Om Prakash Chautala says that ""Sonia Gandhi is a pardesi, so congress is not good for their country""
Many Controversies have been associated with INLD leaders since the beginning of his political career.[7]
INLD leader Om Parkash Chautala was publicly disowned by his father Devi Lal. He had allegedly smuggled gold watches worth Rs 100,000. Even his sons had been accused of being involved in controversies.[8]
Meham was perhaps INLD biggest political controversy, which brought him into national attention. The shadow of Meham was to dog OP Chautala right up to 1996, when the Justice K.N. Saikia Commission indicted him as an accessory after the fact in the killing of Amir Singh.[9]
INLD president OP Chautala has been accused of protecting the then Director General of Police, SPS Rathore in the Ruchika Girhotra child molestation case. The matter, as of now, is sub-judice.[10]
Indicting the former Chief Minister, his two sons, Abhay and Ajay, and their wives for amassing disproportionate assets worth Rs 1,467 crore, the CBI has filed a chargesheet in a Delhi Court. The CBI has submitted that Om Prakash Chautala and his family acquired more than 80 properties in different parts of India from 1993 to 2006.[11]
Om Parkash Chautala is also accused in number of other cases including the much publicised JBT Scam. The CBI filed Chargesheet, as per which in the year 1999–2000, 3032 teachers were recruited by the former CM and his son Ajay Chautala along with the other accused on the basis of forged documents. The matter was registered by the CBI on the direction of the Supreme Court and the CBI seized documents and properties in lakhs from various places.[12]
Chautalas are all set to face fresh trouble as the CBI has recommended registration of cases of cheating, forgery and conspiracy against him and several top officers, including two former chief secretaries, in the HCS nomination recruitment scandal. [13] [14] He has been accused of changing of criteria several times, awarding higher marks to candidates in interviews, dropping the vigilance and departmental inquiries against favoured candidates, tampering with and ignoring the deserving candidates’ records. This was how candidates were recruited for the Haryana Civil Services (Executive) in 2004, revealed CBI.a [15]
Om Parkash Chautala & his family is accused by their opponents to amass wealth using the official position.[16] He was presented numerous costly presents including crowns ans Gold Brick.[17]

In 2004, INLD contested on 20 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Chandigarh, but 14 of those could npt even secure their deposits and none of them won. Its 10 candidates in Haryana could secure 22.43 per cent votes, its 5 candidates got 0.52 per cent votes, its 4 candidates in Uttar Pradesh got 0.02 per cent votes and its lone candidate in Chandigarh UT got 6.61 per cent votes. [4].
In the Lok Sabha elections 1999 INLD had an electoral alliance with BJP in Haryana. Each party contested five of the ten seats in the state. All ten got elected. In 2000 Chautala was elected as Chief Minister of Haryana for the fifth time. In the 2000 state assembly elections in 2000 INLD won 47 out of the 90 seats (in total the party had 62 candidates).

However, in the 2005 Haryana state assembly elections, INLD lost its majority, winning just 9 out of the 90 seats compared to the Congress party's 67 seats. In 2009, the INLD led alliance sprung up a surprise by winning 32 seats (INLD won 31 & its ally SAD won one seat), 23 more than the last elections. This shows that the INLD still retains the Jat votes.

Chaudhary Devi Lal was one of those first generation political leaders of the country who provided the link between the times of freedom struggle and times since achievement of Independence. With values imbibed during the freedom struggle, he relentlessly toiled for the welfare of the masses and rose to becoming Chief Minister of the State of Haryana and later Deputy Prime Minister of India.
Inspired by the ideals of the veterans of the freedom struggle like Lala Lajpat Rai andJawarharlal Nehru, he abandoned education rather early for fighting as a foot soldier against the British rulers. He was an active participant in Mahatma Gandhi's Civil Disobedience Movement. In the process, he spent more than four years of his early years of life in jail.
He strongly believed, and rightly so, that the peasantry is the backbone of India. Though he was himself the son of a big landlord, he was very keen on giving a fair deal to tenants and the labouring classes, especially the Dalits. He stood for enfranchisement oflands held on tenancy.
Chaudhary Devi Lal was also deeply inspired by the Ideals of Acharya Vinoba Bhave and participated in the Bhoodan Movement.
He stood for modernization of agriculture. He was a strong supporter of induction of: High Yielding Varieties technology, water conservation, energisation of agriculture and, most importantly, remunerative prices for farm produce. It was during his tenure as Deputy Prime Minister with charge of Agriculture portfolio that true beginnings were made for the establishment of the National Policy on Agriculture,
Rural development was close to his heart. As Deputy Prime Minister, he gave a new direction to the Planning process and called for significant enhancement of resource allocations for rural development. He wanted the cooperative movement to be strengthened too. In the true Gandhi an tradition, he urged for development of artisanal employments in the rural areas,
Chaudhary Devi Lal also wanted meaningful investments in education, especially in a manner relevant to employment for the youth. ""While he addressed the concerns of the youth in terms of education and skill development, he worked for the social security of the aged like through provision of Old Age Pensions.
He was one of the architects of the State of Haryana, the creation of which materialized in 1966. The features of the model of administration he believed in were balanced regional development, welfare and decentralization.
In politics, he was a true secularist. He abhorred involvement of business houses in politics and advised his followers to keep the business of politics outside the politics of business. He stood for probity and standards in public life,
He wanted the emergence of a strong 'third force' in politics and made his own contribution to this by the sheer dint of his personality. The manner in which he elegantly declined the position of the Prime Minister of the country in favour of Hon'ble Shri VP. Singh when he was unanimously elected as Leader of the Parliamentary Party in 1989 will go down in the annals ofIndia's political history as a rare and supreme example of selflessness.
Chaudhary Devi Lal was truly a national leader, even as his parliamentary career would reflect. When has was a member of Seventh Lok Sabha from 1980-1982, he represented Sonepat in Haryana. Second time over, when he was member of the Ninth Lok Sabha from 1989-1991, he had been returned from the State of Rajasthan, from the Sikar Parliamentary constituency.
Chaudhary Devi Lal, like Mahatma Gandhi himself, had the rare capability of totally identifying himself with the masses. The dress he wore, the food he ate, the language he spoke and the interests he unfailingly fought for were those of the masses.
This work gives rare insights into the making, thoughts and deeds of one of the greatest sons of India.

Krishan Kant Former Vice-President of India
I am happy to know that a book edited by Shri Ajay Singh Chautala, M.P. titled 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out, commemorating his multifaceted contributions to the country. Chaudhary Devi Lal was one of the prominent leaders during India's struggle for Independence as well as in the post-independence politics. He was truly a mass leader, who enjoyed the unreserved support and affection of the people, especially the farmers, whom he served with boundless zeal and commitment. His strong espousal of farmers' cause positioned him among the frontline leaders of his times. In his long public career, Chaudhary Devi Lal served with great distinction, both in the State as the people's Chief Minister and in the Centre as the Deputy Prime Minister. He was universally respected for his deep sense of values, service and character, besides his simple, natural and earthy nature. His services to Haryana and the country are truly unforgettable. This is a welcome opportunity for his large circle of friends and admirers to recount the many-splendoured personality of Chaudhary Devi Lal. I wish the publication all success.



Former Prime Minister of India

I am happy to learn that a book under the title 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out. Chaudhary Sahib was not only tall in physical personality, but also in fighting for the cause of poor, oppressed and the depressed.
Chaudhary Devi Lal's philosophy had two main objectives. One was to attain the Independence for his country, which he loved very intensely. He contributed his mite to this by participating in the freedom struggle. The second objective was to struggle without rest or waiting for the emancipation of poor, downtrodden and farmers. He firmly believed that to remove poverty and to make poor to live a dignified life, Agriculture has to be inevitably developed. Though born in a family of Landlords, he campaigned for the cause of tenants and labourers. He firmly believed that, without improving Agriculture and the poor farmers who are engaged in it, it is just impossible to achieve over-all economic development and to remove poverty.
His whole life was a continuous struggle, without compromising, for improving the conditions of farmers and agriculture. In this aspect, Chaudhary Devi Lal's is a shining model inspiring all of us forever.
He had occupied the high post of Deputy Prime Minister of India declining to become the Prime Minister. During his tenure as Chief Minister of Haryana, the State witnessed unparalleled development in rural, social and industrial infrastructural sectors.
I am confident that the book that is being brought out will continue to inspire the future generations in regard to his love for the country, farmers and agriculture.
I wish the Chief Editor of this book, Shri Ajay Singh Chautala, Member of Parliament, all success in his efforts to make the book a memorable one.




Chandra Shekhar Former Prime Minister of India
I am happy to know that a book on 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out on the former Deputy Prime Minister of India. Ch. Devi Lal, a veteran Freedom Fighter, a man of masses and champion of Kisans has left an indelible mark on the history of our country. He was one of the titans produced by Freedom Movement. In the initial years of Independence, he fought many battles. At the time of re-organisation of States he raised his voice for a separate State of Haryana and launched massive movement against the Chief Ministers of Punjab, Shri Pratap Singh Kairon and Shri Bhim Sen Sachar and his role in the formation of present State of Haryana is significant. Chaudhary Devi Lal was one of the architects of Haryana for making it a front ranking state of the Country. He was a leader of national stature, who had undergone many ups and downs in his political career. Like a true villager, he spoke what he thought but his sincerity and conviction in pursuing his cherished goal of upliftment of village community cannot be doubted. He sought to give primacy to agriculture in India's socio-economic life. He championed the cause of rural poor and peasants at every stage.
His contribution to nation-building particularly at the grass root level and as Deputy Prime Minister in my Ministry can not be over emphasized. He played an important crucial role in determining the direction of agricultural development and rural uplift.
As Haryana Chief Minister, he took several measures for Agricultural growth as also for the welfare of rural community, such as Old Age Pension Scheme for which he is popularly known as Tau and respected.
I was closely associated with him since the days of Emergency. As Chief Minister of State of Haryana his role to promote and to bring recognition to the village life, the craftsmen and the farmers will always be remembered.
As Deputy Prime Minister in my Cabinet he took many measures for agricultural development.
It is hoped that the younger generation would take inspiration from his ideals to which he stood firm and worked for uplift of rural community despite differences with the concept of urban elite.





Parkash Singh Badal Former Chief Minister, Punjab
It gives me immense pleasure to know that a book on 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out on Ch. Devi Lal, former Deputy Prime Minister of India and a multi-dimensional personality. Jan Nayak Chaudhary Devi Lal was a legendary, towering figure, a tireless crusader and the massiah of common people fondly remembered as 'Tau'. During his long social and political career, he had always adhered to the values of secularism and humanism and championed the cause of the weak. He lived a principled life and kept the people's interest uppermost in mind than self. He raised his irrepressible voice against excesses on the 'have nots' and launched various revolutionary schemes which are still benefiting lakhs of people. The laudable contribution of Chaudhry Sahib during the dark days of emergency for restoring democratic rights to the people and freedom of the Press will be ever remembered.
Ch. Devi Lal was indeed a man of the masses. The effort of bringing out book on life and works of Chaudhary Sahib is indeed laudable and I wish it all success.





Dr. Farooq Abdullah
It's quite in place that we recall that great 'Tau' of Indianpolity who stayed as a leading light in the country's political firmament for over four decades. Chaudhry Devi Lal - the very name evokes reminiscences of a blunt, plain spoken, towering, even domineering personality. The aura of his out-reaching honesty and incorrigible ingenuity would, in fact, be lost on no one who ever came across him. He spurned office and shunned authority for his austere and egalitarian moorings. Even as Jat peasantry was his main forte, the great Chaudhry did not dwell in caste or communal moulds. I only wish the genre of politicians today to imbibe and emulate such views and values.



Naveen Patnaik Chief Minister, Orissa
It gives me immense pleasure to learn that a book on the veteran leader Chaudhary Devi Lal entitled as 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is going to be published shortly.
Chaudhary Devi Lal was a leader of the masses. He had devoted his entire life for the development of rural India. He had all along been espousing the cause of the peasants, the poor and the down-trodden. His concern for the development of agriculture and rural economy is well known. Chaudhary Devi Lal was a great patriot and freedom fighter and a good friend of Biju Babu.
I pay my respectful homage to this great personality of our country and wish the publication all success.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE
Ch. Devi Lal's life and work were devoted to the service of peasants, the poor and the under-privileged. He gave all he had to them and did not expect anything in return. He emerged from the backwaters of Haryana, born in a traditional family, broke all traditions, set new standards in public life, gave a new identity to rural masses and a new direction to the country's policy makers. He was a mature politician, a popular leader, an efficient administrator and a good human being. Those who did not come in contact with him and the future generations need to be told that a man like him did live in flesh and blood. This is a fascinating story.
And who are the persons to tell this story? Who else but those who have known him from close quarters, who have watched his life being shaped and influenced by the environment he lived in and have seen him working in his own typical style to leave a mark on the minds of the masses. That the first piece should have come from his son, Haryana Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala, is only natural. Ch. Om Prakash was very dear to him and was groomed by him to take to his ways and style. Nobody else could have known Ch. Devi Lal as intimately as he did, both in personal and public life. That the second chapter should have been written by me, Ch. Devi Lal's grandson, is also no surprise as I had also followed his later years' work keenly and closely. It is said that the generation gap disappears between family elders and their grandchildren and that they interact more freely and frankly than is possible between two consecutive generations.
What follows is the narration of a story in different parts by educationists and agricultural experts who have studied Ch. Devi Lal's life, work and philosophy as keen students of the politics and public life in the region. Some of them like Dr. S. S.Johl, Ch. Sultan Singh, Dr. K. L.Johar, Sh. A. L. Chaudhary, Dr. Harswarup Singh and Dr. P. S. Lamba had come in personal contact with him in working life. Others like Prof. K. C. Yadav, Prof. Hoshiar Singh, Prof. H. L. Verma, Sh. D. K. Kasnia, Dr. Hawa Singh, Dr. Rajpal Singh, Prof. S. D. Chambola, Prof. C. P. Malik and Dr. P. K. Vasudeva have made a scholarly study of his life and times to relate his story to that of the times. Some others like Prof. Sher Singh, Ch. Abhay Singh Chautala, Sh. S. N. Malik, Sh. S. P. Goel, Sh. Ashok Gupta, Monalisa Studio, Hisar and Sh. R. K. Khullar also deserve appreciations for their contribution and support in the preparation of this book.
There is a large variety of subjects-his role in freedom struggle, peasants' and tenants' movements, direction to agriculture policy, contribution towards uplift of the poor and the backward, creation of Haryana state, view of new fields like biotechnology and WTO, passion for nation-building and compassion for the non-elite sections of society. Some events in his life, some traits of his personality and some points of his philosophy may have been repeated but it is only to emphasise them. Also, when different persons are looking at him, they have different interpretations for them.
That such a book should have come so late, after his departure from the scene, is surprising. He would not know what others thought about him but, then, he was so different. He did not react to what others said about him. He went about working for causes dear to him unmindful of how others would take it. The fact is that his life, work and philosophy were over-looked by the intellectuals and the elitist, vocal sections of the society whose comments and opinions on public figures and public issues would make all the difference to resolve and determination of a person to carry on his mission or give up on the way. Not that it would have made a big difference to Ch. Devi Lal who had a one track mind when it came to serving the people. It is only proper that some of the intellectuals have thought of making a serious study about the man and his achievements and gave me the privilege of editing their thoughtful articles and presenting them in a book form. It would be only a part of what was due to Ch. Devi Lal. Perhaps it will mark the beginning of a series of books on him-there can be an independent book on each of his major activities and the ideas behind it.
Different chapters in this book narrate some of his life story and discuss his thinking on various subjects as well as translation of his ideas into practical campaigns and crusades on ground. Whether he felt the need to agitate against the British rulers compelling them to free Indian nation from the shackles of slavery or the need to campaign against their Indian successors for getting a better deal for the oppressed and deprived sections of society, he exerted to the maximum of his strength and resources to achieve his objective. Given his physical and mental strength and the mood of the youth in his early life, he could have become a revolutionary like Sardar Bhagat Singh and his comrades whom he adored. But he opted for Mahatma Gandhi's non-violent ways of agitation. He stuck to them till the last.
As the various chapters of this book unfold different aspects of his multi-facet, multi-dimension personality, the word compassion is repeated by more than one contributors, it is natural because this was the very basic quality, which nobody could have missed noticing in his life and work. He cared for human values, had a consideration for the suffering and woes of the common man. He was sensitive to all that he observed around him and wanted to do something for all, something that would answer their questions and solve their problems. What is more, he loved them all and had a large extended family. Be it his family, his clan, his followers, his countrymen, friends and foes alike, he was keen to serve them all without discrimination and to make this place better to live for not anyone section but for all sections of society. He forgave those clever politicians who considered him a novice and tried to take advantage of his simplicity and smooth sophistication which goes with the politics of the day. He did not mind the superiority complex of the bureaucrats and intellectual elite who he impressed ultimately with his sincerity of purpose and simple solutions to complex problems. He was unmindful even of the smart guys in the media who sometimes made fun of his rustic ways. In fact, he had the best of relations with the newspapermen all his life, whether he was in power or in opposition. Even while in opposition, he was respectful of the media. He could not throw lavish parties at his press conferences but made it up by bringing melons from village in his own car for his press friends. He respected the talent and experience of senior officials but would not let them take him for a ride. He was very considerate to his juniors and small employees too. Those who worked for him in any capacity enjoyed the assignment. In fact, they loved and respected the grand old man. This much for his human relations, all because he loved all human beings! A lot more can be said in this strain. It can be an unending story about the legend that Ch Devi Lal came to be for the people. This book is the beginning of that story.
To compile this book was not an easy task as it involved too much of academic work and commitment of time. For a person like me having a lot of other public engagements sparing time was perhaps the most difficult thing. But inner motivation and encouragement from my family could help to achieve this goal. I would like to place on record my appreciations for all the contributors of the papers and others who remained associated in the preparation of the book. All my well wishers and friends also deserve my special thanks for their cooperation and encouragement in this endeavour.

REMINISCENCES OF A SON
Om Prakash Chautala
How does one remember the life and work of a man, who, as father, taught you the rudiments of life, but never belonged to you fully since he was part of a larger world, also responsible for the well being of all others around him. Nevertheless, I have had the privilege of having an intimate peep into the character and personality of my father Ch. Devi Lal, both as a son as well as one of his most devoted followers in public life. If he taught me how to conduct myself in the family as a child, he also taught me to rise above narrow personal and sectional interests and develop a balanced and humanitarian overview of life.
I must confess that when I first became conscious of the world around me, I was a little perplexed that my father did not lead the normal life like others. There would be moments when I wished my father entirely to myself, like all other children. And yet, my mother's prompting and some deep instinct instructed my very impressionable and young mind that my father was no ordinary human being, and that if he was devoting less attention to me and others in the family, it was because he had to accomplish some other more important tasks. Soon I was to learn that though I was his eldest son, his affection was for a large number of children and people. Rarely did I feel the pangs of jealousy. On the contrary, I always felt elated at the realization that everyone vied for the attention of my father! Those were by all means proud and happy moments of my childhood.
The life and work of Ch. Devi Lal can easily be divided and analysed in three phases, each one more significant and momentous than the other. The first phase, based on the memories and narrations of others, deals with the period before the country's independence. The second phase of his life concerns a period of 30 years beginning with India's independence, and deals with his uninterrupted and uncompromising struggle for securing justice for the people and the region that is now Haryana. The third phase begins with 1977 when he first adorned the office of the Chief Minister of Haryana, a period of governance which was genuinely devoted to creating a modern welfare state, a model for other states.

CALL OF THE MAHATMA
Commitment and dedication to his chosen cause was a hallmark of his character right from his childhood. It was this dedication which made him drop out of the school so that he could respond to the call of Mahatma Gandhi and work as a humble soldier in the freedom struggle. He was deeply influenced by the likes of Lala Lajpat Rai, Martyr Bhagat Singh and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. These leaders, specially their philosophies of life influenced Ch. Devi Lal, and taught him to be ever willing to make any sacrifice when the occasion demanded. They also reinforced his inherent belief in truthfulness, commitment to noble causes and strengthened and intensified his empathy for the poor and the down-trodden.
By the time India attained independence, Ch. Devi Lal had already made his mark as a fearless leader, who could swim against the current if it brought justice to the poor. In 1946, he led the movement for the ownership rights of the tenants, and even in the face of opposition from his own family, he succeeded in bestowing ownership rights to the tenants. Life started looking up slowly but inevitably for the small farmers and the landless.
The second phase of his life marks a period of intense struggle, when under-privileged human beings would have felt intimidated by the disillusionment, frustration and exasperation at not being able to undo a wrong. And yet, unmindful of the setbacks and frequent betrayals by his friends and followers, he went ahead, making the poor, the backward and the farmers aware of their rights and just expectations from the state. This period is indebted to him because his efforts resulted in making the republican spirit of the Indian Constitution an integral part of our life.
This period also marks the creation of the state of Haryana. In an era when the presence of the Congress at the Centre and in the states made it impossible for the Congressmen to express dissent even on matters of high moral principles, Ch. Devi Lal showed exceptional courage in bringing out repeatedly facts and figures both in the Punjab Assembly and outside, to expose the prejudices and blatant injustice against those Hindi-speaking regions of Punjab which now constitute Haryana. It was Ch. Devi Lal's continuous crusade against injustice perpetrated by the then rulers of Punjab that finally resulted in the creation of a state where socio-economic aspirations of the Haryanavis could be realized.

MIDAS TOUCH
This was also a period when I came out of the confines of the home and became an integrated member of his large, extended family. It was then that I began my real education not only in the field of politics, but also in the affairs of humanity, where compassion and empathy were the primary lessons. His organizational skills were unmatched, and his man-management excellent. But what made him stand much above the rest of the leaders was his ability to make the lowly and the weak to aspire boldly for a better and a brighter future. He possessed the midas touch, and all those who came in contact with him went back with the realisation that they carried socio-political responsibility on their shoulders. Their weak shoulders became broad and stout the moment they exchanged a few words and shared their 'hooka' with Ch. Devi Lal.
This period is also memorable as the Prime Minister of the country made a determined attempt to trample democratic principles of the country, and the uncom promising response of the people to such fascist and dictatorial efforts. Not surprisingly, he was again in the forefront of this battle. This period is also significant since the farmers of the state had to wage persistent crusades for claiming their dues. The mantle of leadership for such movements was obviously to fall upon Ch. Devi Lal.

CREATIVE PHASE
The unequivocal verdict of the people of the country in general, and Haryana in particular, was delivered in the general elections to the Lok Sabha in 1977, and the democratic principles and sanctity of the constitution was restored. In the summer of the same year, general elections to the State Assembly were held and for the first time Ch. Devi Lal became Chief Minister of Haryana, thereby heralding his third and the most creative phase.
For the first time in modern era, the rural people in general and the farmers, the poor and the backward classes in particular, were made to feel that they were part of the decision-making process.
He became Chief Minister, again in 1987, and worked fiercely for the welfare of the masses, there were good results.
Thus, both his tenures were characterized by intense activity on the development front for the rural sector. If his first tenure was remembered for the reduction of interest on loans taken by farmers and labourers, the brick-lining of the water channels, implementation of matching grants for development of villages, the second is remembered for even more momentous decisions. In a historical decision, he freed the farmers, the backward classes and the small shopkeepers of the debt trap when their loans were waived. He also had an eye for the weakest in the society. That is why he offered a Rupee a day' scheme for the children of the nomadic tribes to draw them to schools and education. He also implemented a scheme to give financial assistance of Rs. 300 each to the women belonging to the Scheduled Caste at the time of child birth to enable them to have nutritious diet.
As I have mentioned already, I knew at a very young age that my father was not an ordinary person, and certainly not an ordinary father. I saw his fatherly image grow till it had under its wings the whole of the country. His paternal concern for all was well known, but it was his second term as Chief Minister which saw him evolve as 'Tau' of the society.

INDIVIDUAL’S DIGNITY
When he proclaimed old--age pension in Haryana, he acknowledged that the old and the infirm were entitled to dignity in their twilight years, and, that the state was duty bound to take care of those who had been laid low by age. In his concern for the old, he did not forget the young, who, though educated, were forced to ask for maintenance allowance from their families because of unemployment. He offered them token allowance and the privilege to travel free in public transport when going for an interview. History shows that there was a race among the rest of the states in the country to launch such welfare schemes. But Ch. Devi Lal was the first to have the sensitivity and the courage to admit that if there was no provision in the government budgets for such schemes, such a provision had to be made. This earned him the affectionate and respectful title of 'Tau' . It is a title that has come straight out of the hearts of the people across the length and breadth of the country, and is a result of the spontaneous expression of thanks.
He loved to be addressed as 'Tau', for he knew that this single household word had ensured a place for him in history. This perhaps explains his refusal to be the Prime Minister, though he was elected unanimously the Leader of the United Front Parliamentary Party. He said at that time that the people of the country address him as 'Tau', and he on his part preferred that role much more!
It is another matter that he became Deputy Prime Minister twice after that episode in 1989, but his concern for the farmers, the poor and the backward classes remained paramount always. In 1979, he had staked his office of Chief Minister by deciding to attend a farmers' rally being held to felicitate late Ch. Charan Singh; in 1990 he was again to stake everything for espousing the cause of the farmers while being in the VP.Singh government.
The cause or the issue was always greater than the office for him, and all his life he remained committed to the cause of the welfare of the farming community, and the issue of removal of poverty. For this he was ever willing to walk an extra mile, to make any sacrifice. But he was also aware that the means for achieving the goals have to be just, democratic and constitutional. This alone explains the evolution of his famous quote 'Lok Raj, Lok laj se chalta hai' A lofty goal can only be achieved through noble means, this is amply proved by his 72 years of work in public life.

Widely acclaimed as Vikas Purush of Haryana, Chaudhary Om Parkash Chautala comes of a famous political family of the country, having its roots in the village Chautala (Haryana) bordering the state of Rajasthan in India. He is the eldest son of Late Ch. Devi Lal, a veteran freedom fighter and affectionately known as Tau to one and all, whose illustrious political career culminated in his becoming the Deputy Prime Minister of the country in the year 1989.
Ajay Singh Chautala (b. 13 March 1961), son of Shri Om Prakash Chautala, Chief Minister, Haryana and grandson of Ch. Devi Lal, did his B.A. from Kurukshetra University, M.A. (Public Administration) and LL.B. from Rajasthan University. He joined active politics in 1980s, became MLA from Rajasthan twice: first from Data Ram Garh (1989) and then from Nauhar (1993). He becameMember of Parliament from Bhiwani Constituency. He is currently member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha). He became President of the Youth Wing of Indian National Lok Dal and secretary General of Indian National Lokdal Party.

Chaudhary Devi Lal was one of those first generation political leaders of the country who provided the link between the times of freedom struggle and times since achievement of Independence. With values imbibed during the freedom struggle, he relentlessly toiled for the welfare of the masses and rose to becoming Chief Minister of the State of Haryana and later Deputy Prime Minister of India.
Inspired by the ideals of the veterans of the freedom struggle like Lala Lajpat Rai andJawarharlal Nehru, he abandoned education rather early for fighting as a foot soldier against the British rulers. He was an active participant in Mahatma Gandhi's Civil Disobedience Movement. In the process, he spent more than four years of his early years of life in jail.
He strongly believed, and rightly so, that the peasantry is the backbone of India. Though he was himself the son of a big landlord, he was very keen on giving a fair deal to tenants and the labouring classes, especially the Dalits. He stood for enfranchisement oflands held on tenancy.
Chaudhary Devi Lal was also deeply inspired by the Ideals of Acharya Vinoba Bhave and participated in the Bhoodan Movement.
He stood for modernization of agriculture. He was a strong supporter of induction of: High Yielding Varieties technology, water conservation, energisation of agriculture and, most importantly, remunerative prices for farm produce. It was during his tenure as Deputy Prime Minister with charge of Agriculture portfolio that true beginnings were made for the establishment of the National Policy on Agriculture,
Rural development was close to his heart. As Deputy Prime Minister, he gave a new direction to the Planning process and called for significant enhancement of resource allocations for rural development. He wanted the cooperative movement to be strengthened too. In the true Gandhi an tradition, he urged for development of artisanal employments in the rural areas,
Chaudhary Devi Lal also wanted meaningful investments in education, especially in a manner relevant to employment for the youth. ""While he addressed the concerns of the youth in terms of education and skill development, he worked for the social security of the aged like through provision of Old Age Pensions.
He was one of the architects of the State of Haryana, the creation of which materialized in 1966. The features of the model of administration he believed in were balanced regional development, welfare and decentralization.
In politics, he was a true secularist. He abhorred involvement of business houses in politics and advised his followers to keep the business of politics outside the politics of business. He stood for probity and standards in public life,
He wanted the emergence of a strong 'third force' in politics and made his own contribution to this by the sheer dint of his personality. The manner in which he elegantly declined the position of the Prime Minister of the country in favour of Hon'ble Shri VP. Singh when he was unanimously elected as Leader of the Parliamentary Party in 1989 will go down in the annals ofIndia's political history as a rare and supreme example of selflessness.
Chaudhary Devi Lal was truly a national leader, even as his parliamentary career would reflect. When has was a member of Seventh Lok Sabha from 1980-1982, he represented Sonepat in Haryana. Second time over, when he was member of the Ninth Lok Sabha from 1989-1991, he had been returned from the State of Rajasthan, from the Sikar Parliamentary constituency.
Chaudhary Devi Lal, like Mahatma Gandhi himself, had the rare capability of totally identifying himself with the masses. The dress he wore, the food he ate, the language he spoke and the interests he unfailingly fought for were those of the masses.
This work gives rare insights into the making, thoughts and deeds of one of the greatest sons of India.

I am happy to know that a book edited by Shri Ajay Singh Chautala, M.P. titled 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out, commemorating his multifaceted contributions to the country. Chaudhary Devi Lal was one of the prominent leaders during India's struggle for Independence as well as in the post-independence politics. He was truly a mass leader, who enjoyed the unreserved support and affection of the people, especially the farmers, whom he served with boundless zeal and commitment. His strong espousal of farmers' cause positioned him among the frontline leaders of his times. In his long public career, Chaudhary Devi Lal served with great distinction, both in the State as the people's Chief Minister and in the Centre as the Deputy Prime Minister. He was universally respected for his deep sense of values, service and character, besides his simple, natural and earthy nature. His services to Haryana and the country are truly unforgettable. This is a welcome opportunity for his large circle of friends and admirers to recount the many-splendoured personality of Chaudhary Devi Lal. I wish the publication all success.



Former Prime Minister of India

I am happy to learn that a book under the title 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out. Chaudhary Sahib was not only tall in physical personality, but also in fighting for the cause of poor, oppressed and the depressed.
Chaudhary Devi Lal's philosophy had two main objectives. One was to attain the Independence for his country, which he loved very intensely. He contributed his mite to this by participating in the freedom struggle. The second objective was to struggle without rest or waiting for the emancipation of poor, downtrodden and farmers. He firmly believed that to remove poverty and to make poor to live a dignified life, Agriculture has to be inevitably developed. Though born in a family of Landlords, he campaigned for the cause of tenants and labourers. He firmly believed that, without improving Agriculture and the poor farmers who are engaged in it, it is just impossible to achieve over-all economic development and to remove poverty.
His whole life was a continuous struggle, without compromising, for improving the conditions of farmers and agriculture. In this aspect, Chaudhary Devi Lal's is a shining model inspiring all of us forever.
He had occupied the high post of Deputy Prime Minister of India declining to become the Prime Minister. During his tenure as Chief Minister of Haryana, the State witnessed unparalleled development in rural, social and industrial infrastructural sectors.
I am confident that the book that is being brought out will continue to inspire the future generations in regard to his love for the country, farmers and agriculture.
I wish the Chief Editor of this book, Shri Ajay Singh Chautala, Member of Parliament, all success in his efforts to make the book a memorable one.




Chandra Shekhar Former Prime Minister of India
I am happy to know that a book on 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out on the former Deputy Prime Minister of India. Ch. Devi Lal, a veteran Freedom Fighter, a man of masses and champion of Kisans has left an indelible mark on the history of our country. He was one of the titans produced by Freedom Movement. In the initial years of Independence, he fought many battles. At the time of re-organisation of States he raised his voice for a separate State of Haryana and launched massive movement against the Chief Ministers of Punjab, Shri Pratap Singh Kairon and Shri Bhim Sen Sachar and his role in the formation of present State of Haryana is significant. Chaudhary Devi Lal was one of the architects of Haryana for making it a front ranking state of the Country. He was a leader of national stature, who had undergone many ups and downs in his political career. Like a true villager, he spoke what he thought but his sincerity and conviction in pursuing his cherished goal of upliftment of village community cannot be doubted. He sought to give primacy to agriculture in India's socio-economic life. He championed the cause of rural poor and peasants at every stage.
His contribution to nation-building particularly at the grass root level and as Deputy Prime Minister in my Ministry can not be over emphasized. He played an important crucial role in determining the direction of agricultural development and rural uplift.
As Haryana Chief Minister, he took several measures for Agricultural growth as also for the welfare of rural community, such as Old Age Pension Scheme for which he is popularly known as Tau and respected.
I was closely associated with him since the days of Emergency. As Chief Minister of State of Haryana his role to promote and to bring recognition to the village life, the craftsmen and the farmers will always be remembered.
As Deputy Prime Minister in my Cabinet he took many measures for agricultural development.
It is hoped that the younger generation would take inspiration from his ideals to which he stood firm and worked for uplift of rural community despite differences with the concept of urban elite.





Parkash Singh Badal Former Chief Minister, Punjab
It gives me immense pleasure to know that a book on 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out on Ch. Devi Lal, former Deputy Prime Minister of India and a multi-dimensional personality. Jan Nayak Chaudhary Devi Lal was a legendary, towering figure, a tireless crusader and the massiah of common people fondly remembered as 'Tau'. During his long social and political career, he had always adhered to the values of secularism and humanism and championed the cause of the weak. He lived a principled life and kept the people's interest uppermost in mind than self. He raised his irrepressible voice against excesses on the 'have nots' and launched various revolutionary schemes which are still benefiting lakhs of people. The laudable contribution of Chaudhry Sahib during the dark days of emergency for restoring democratic rights to the people and freedom of the Press will be ever remembered.
Ch. Devi Lal was indeed a man of the masses. The effort of bringing out book on life and works of Chaudhary Sahib is indeed laudable and I wish it all success.





Dr. Farooq Abdullah
It's quite in place that we recall that great 'Tau' of Indianpolity who stayed as a leading light in the country's political firmament for over four decades. Chaudhry Devi Lal - the very name evokes reminiscences of a blunt, plain spoken, towering, even domineering personality. The aura of his out-reaching honesty and incorrigible ingenuity would, in fact, be lost on no one who ever came across him. He spurned office and shunned authority for his austere and egalitarian moorings. Even as Jat peasantry was his main forte, the great Chaudhry did not dwell in caste or communal moulds. I only wish the genre of politicians today to imbibe and emulate such views and values.



Naveen Patnaik Chief Minister, Orissa
It gives me immense pleasure to learn that a book on the veteran leader Chaudhary Devi Lal entitled as 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is going to be published shortly.
Chaudhary Devi Lal was a leader of the masses. He had devoted his entire life for the development of rural India. He had all along been espousing the cause of the peasants, the poor and the down-trodden. His concern for the development of agriculture and rural economy is well known. Chaudhary Devi Lal was a great patriot and freedom fighter and a good friend of Biju Babu.
I pay my respectful homage to this great personality of our country and wish the publication all success.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE
Ch. Devi Lal's life and work were devoted to the service of peasants, the poor and the under-privileged. He gave all he had to them and did not expect anything in return. He emerged from the backwaters of Haryana, born in a traditional family, broke all traditions, set new standards in public life, gave a new identity to rural masses and a new direction to the country's policy makers. He was a mature politician, a popular leader, an efficient administrator and a good human being. Those who did not come in contact with him and the future generations need to be told that a man like him did live in flesh and blood. This is a fascinating story.
And who are the persons to tell this story? Who else but those who have known him from close quarters, who have watched his life being shaped and influenced by the environment he lived in and have seen him working in his own typical style to leave a mark on the minds of the masses. That the first piece should have come from his son, Haryana Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala, is only natural. Ch. Om Prakash was very dear to him and was groomed by him to take to his ways and style. Nobody else could have known Ch. Devi Lal as intimately as he did, both in personal and public life. That the second chapter should have been written by me, Ch. Devi Lal's grandson, is also no surprise as I had also followed his later years' work keenly and closely. It is said that the generation gap disappears between family elders and their grandchildren and that they interact more freely and frankly than is possible between two consecutive generations.
What follows is the narration of a story in different parts by educationists and agricultural experts who have studied Ch. Devi Lal's life, work and philosophy as keen students of the politics and public life in the region. Some of them like Dr. S. S.Johl, Ch. Sultan Singh, Dr. K. L.Johar, Sh. A. L. Chaudhary, Dr. Harswarup Singh and Dr. P. S. Lamba had come in personal contact with him in working life. Others like Prof. K. C. Yadav, Prof. Hoshiar Singh, Prof. H. L. Verma, Sh. D. K. Kasnia, Dr. Hawa Singh, Dr. Rajpal Singh, Prof. S. D. Chambola, Prof. C. P. Malik and Dr. P. K. Vasudeva have made a scholarly study of his life and times to relate his story to that of the times. Some others like Prof. Sher Singh, Ch. Abhay Singh Chautala, Sh. S. N. Malik, Sh. S. P. Goel, Sh. Ashok Gupta, Monalisa Studio, Hisar and Sh. R. K. Khullar also deserve appreciations for their contribution and support in the preparation of this book.
There is a large variety of subjects-his role in freedom struggle, peasants' and tenants' movements, direction to agriculture policy, contribution towards uplift of the poor and the backward, creation of Haryana state, view of new fields like biotechnology and WTO, passion for nation-building and compassion for the non-elite sections of society. Some events in his life, some traits of his personality and some points of his philosophy may have been repeated but it is only to emphasise them. Also, when different persons are looking at him, they have different interpretations for them.
That such a book should have come so late, after his departure from the scene, is surprising. He would not know what others thought about him but, then, he was so different. He did not react to what others said about him. He went about working for causes dear to him unmindful of how others would take it. The fact is that his life, work and philosophy were over-looked by the intellectuals and the elitist, vocal sections of the society whose comments and opinions on public figures and public issues would make all the difference to resolve and determination of a person to carry on his mission or give up on the way. Not that it would have made a big difference to Ch. Devi Lal who had a one track mind when it came to serving the people. It is only proper that some of the intellectuals have thought of making a serious study about the man and his achievements and gave me the privilege of editing their thoughtful articles and presenting them in a book form. It would be only a part of what was due to Ch. Devi Lal. Perhaps it will mark the beginning of a series of books on him-there can be an independent book on each of his major activities and the ideas behind it.
Different chapters in this book narrate some of his life story and discuss his thinking on various subjects as well as translation of his ideas into practical campaigns and crusades on ground. Whether he felt the need to agitate against the British rulers compelling them to free Indian nation from the shackles of slavery or the need to campaign against their Indian successors for getting a better deal for the oppressed and deprived sections of society, he exerted to the maximum of his strength and resources to achieve his objective. Given his physical and mental strength and the mood of the youth in his early life, he could have become a revolutionary like Sardar Bhagat Singh and his comrades whom he adored. But he opted for Mahatma Gandhi's non-violent ways of agitation. He stuck to them till the last.
As the various chapters of this book unfold different aspects of his multi-facet, multi-dimension personality, the word compassion is repeated by more than one contributors, it is natural because this was the very basic quality, which nobody could have missed noticing in his life and work. He cared for human values, had a consideration for the suffering and woes of the common man. He was sensitive to all that he observed around him and wanted to do something for all, something that would answer their questions and solve their problems. What is more, he loved them all and had a large extended family. Be it his family, his clan, his followers, his countrymen, friends and foes alike, he was keen to serve them all without discrimination and to make this place better to live for not anyone section but for all sections of society. He forgave those clever politicians who considered him a novice and tried to take advantage of his simplicity and smooth sophistication which goes with the politics of the day. He did not mind the superiority complex of the bureaucrats and intellectual elite who he impressed ultimately with his sincerity of purpose and simple solutions to complex problems. He was unmindful even of the smart guys in the media who sometimes made fun of his rustic ways. In fact, he had the best of relations with the newspapermen all his life, whether he was in power or in opposition. Even while in opposition, he was respectful of the media. He could not throw lavish parties at his press conferences but made it up by bringing melons from village in his own car for his press friends. He respected the talent and experience of senior officials but would not let them take him for a ride. He was very considerate to his juniors and small employees too. Those who worked for him in any capacity enjoyed the assignment. In fact, they loved and respected the grand old man. This much for his human relations, all because he loved all human beings! A lot more can be said in this strain. It can be an unending story about the legend that Ch Devi Lal came to be for the people. This book is the beginning of that story.
To compile this book was not an easy task as it involved too much of academic work and commitment of time. For a person like me having a lot of other public engagements sparing time was perhaps the most difficult thing. But inner motivation and encouragement from my family could help to achieve this goal. I would like to place on record my appreciations for all the contributors of the papers and others who remained associated in the preparation of the book. All my well wishers and friends also deserve my special thanks for their cooperation and encouragement in this endeavour.

REMINISCENCES OF A SON
Om Prakash Chautala
How does one remember the life and work of a man, who, as father, taught you the rudiments of life, but never belonged to you fully since he was part of a larger world, also responsible for the well being of all others around him. Nevertheless, I have had the privilege of having an intimate peep into the character and personality of my father Ch. Devi Lal, both as a son as well as one of his most devoted followers in public life. If he taught me how to conduct myself in the family as a child, he also taught me to rise above narrow personal and sectional interests and develop a balanced and humanitarian overview of life.
I must confess that when I first became conscious of the world around me, I was a little perplexed that my father did not lead the normal life like others. There would be moments when I wished my father entirely to myself, like all other children. And yet, my mother's prompting and some deep instinct instructed my very impressionable and young mind that my father was no ordinary human being, and that if he was devoting less attention to me and others in the family, it was because he had to accomplish some other more important tasks. Soon I was to learn that though I was his eldest son, his affection was for a large number of children and people. Rarely did I feel the pangs of jealousy. On the contrary, I always felt elated at the realization that everyone vied for the attention of my father! Those were by all means proud and happy moments of my childhood.
The life and work of Ch. Devi Lal can easily be divided and analysed in three phases, each one more significant and momentous than the other. The first phase, based on the memories and narrations of others, deals with the period before the country's independence. The second phase of his life concerns a period of 30 years beginning with India's independence, and deals with his uninterrupted and uncompromising struggle for securing justice for the people and the region that is now Haryana. The third phase begins with 1977 when he first adorned the office of the Chief Minister of Haryana, a period of governance which was genuinely devoted to creating a modern welfare state, a model for other states.

CALL OF THE MAHATMA
Commitment and dedication to his chosen cause was a hallmark of his character right from his childhood. It was this dedication which made him drop out of the school so that he could respond to the call of Mahatma Gandhi and work as a humble soldier in the freedom struggle. He was deeply influenced by the likes of Lala Lajpat Rai, Martyr Bhagat Singh and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. These leaders, specially their philosophies of life influenced Ch. Devi Lal, and taught him to be ever willing to make any sacrifice when the occasion demanded. They also reinforced his inherent belief in truthfulness, commitment to noble causes and strengthened and intensified his empathy for the poor and the down-trodden.
By the time India attained independence, Ch. Devi Lal had already made his mark as a fearless leader, who could swim against the current if it brought justice to the poor. In 1946, he led the movement for the ownership rights of the tenants, and even in the face of opposition from his own family, he succeeded in bestowing ownership rights to the tenants. Life started looking up slowly but inevitably for the small farmers and the landless.
The second phase of his life marks a period of intense struggle, when under-privileged human beings would have felt intimidated by the disillusionment, frustration and exasperation at not being able to undo a wrong. And yet, unmindful of the setbacks and frequent betrayals by his friends and followers, he went ahead, making the poor, the backward and the farmers aware of their rights and just expectations from the state. This period is indebted to him because his efforts resulted in making the republican spirit of the Indian Constitution an integral part of our life.
This period also marks the creation of the state of Haryana. In an era when the presence of the Congress at the Centre and in the states made it impossible for the Congressmen to express dissent even on matters of high moral principles, Ch. Devi Lal showed exceptional courage in bringing out repeatedly facts and figures both in the Punjab Assembly and outside, to expose the prejudices and blatant injustice against those Hindi-speaking regions of Punjab which now constitute Haryana. It was Ch. Devi Lal's continuous crusade against injustice perpetrated by the then rulers of Punjab that finally resulted in the creation of a state where socio-economic aspirations of the Haryanavis could be realized.

MIDAS TOUCH
This was also a period when I came out of the confines of the home and became an integrated member of his large, extended family. It was then that I began my real education not only in the field of politics, but also in the affairs of humanity, where compassion and empathy were the primary lessons. His organizational skills were unmatched, and his man-management excellent. But what made him stand much above the rest of the leaders was his ability to make the lowly and the weak to aspire boldly for a better and a brighter future. He possessed the midas touch, and all those who came in contact with him went back with the realisation that they carried socio-political responsibility on their shoulders. Their weak shoulders became broad and stout the moment they exchanged a few words and shared their 'hooka' with Ch. Devi Lal.
This period is also memorable as the Prime Minister of the country made a determined attempt to trample democratic principles of the country, and the uncom promising response of the people to such fascist and dictatorial efforts. Not surprisingly, he was again in the forefront of this battle. This period is also significant since the farmers of the state had to wage persistent crusades for claiming their dues. The mantle of leadership for such movements was obviously to fall upon Ch. Devi Lal.

CREATIVE PHASE
The unequivocal verdict of the people of the country in general, and Haryana in particular, was delivered in the general elections to the Lok Sabha in 1977, and the democratic principles and sanctity of the constitution was restored. In the summer of the same year, general elections to the State Assembly were held and for the first time Ch. Devi Lal became Chief Minister of Haryana, thereby heralding his third and the most creative phase.
For the first time in modern era, the rural people in general and the farmers, the poor and the backward classes in particular, were made to feel that they were part of the decision-making process.
He became Chief Minister, again in 1987, and worked fiercely for the welfare of the masses, there were good results.
Thus, both his tenures were characterized by intense activity on the development front for the rural sector. If his first tenure was remembered for the reduction of interest on loans taken by farmers and labourers, the brick-lining of the water channels, implementation of matching grants for development of villages, the second is remembered for even more momentous decisions. In a historical decision, he freed the farmers, the backward classes and the small shopkeepers of the debt trap when their loans were waived. He also had an eye for the weakest in the society. That is why he offered a Rupee a day' scheme for the children of the nomadic tribes to draw them to schools and education. He also implemented a scheme to give financial assistance of Rs. 300 each to the women belonging to the Scheduled Caste at the time of child birth to enable them to have nutritious diet.
As I have mentioned already, I knew at a very young age that my father was not an ordinary person, and certainly not an ordinary father. I saw his fatherly image grow till it had under its wings the whole of the country. His paternal concern for all was well known, but it was his second term as Chief Minister which saw him evolve as 'Tau' of the society.

INDIVIDUAL’S DIGNITY
When he proclaimed old--age pension in Haryana, he acknowledged that the old and the infirm were entitled to dignity in their twilight years, and, that the state was duty bound to take care of those who had been laid low by age. In his concern for the old, he did not forget the young, who, though educated, were forced to ask for maintenance allowance from their families because of unemployment. He offered them token allowance and the privilege to travel free in public transport when going for an interview. History shows that there was a race among the rest of the states in the country to launch such welfare schemes. But Ch. Devi Lal was the first to have the sensitivity and the courage to admit that if there was no provision in the government budgets for such schemes, such a provision had to be made. This earned him the affectionate and respectful title of 'Tau' . It is a title that has come straight out of the hearts of the people across the length and breadth of the country, and is a result of the spontaneous expression of thanks.
He loved to be addressed as 'Tau', for he knew that this single household word had ensured a place for him in history. This perhaps explains his refusal to be the Prime Minister, though he was elected unanimously the Leader of the United Front Parliamentary Party. He said at that time that the people of the country address him as 'Tau', and he on his part preferred that role much more!
It is another matter that he became Deputy Prime Minister twice after that episode in 1989, but his concern for the farmers, the poor and the backward classes remained paramount always. In 1979, he had staked his office of Chief Minister by deciding to attend a farmers' rally being held to felicitate late Ch. Charan Singh; in 1990 he was again to stake everything for espousing the cause of the farmers while being in the VP.Singh government.
The cause or the issue was always greater than the office for him, and all his life he remained committed to the cause of the welfare of the farming community, and the issue of removal of poverty. For this he was ever willing to walk an extra mile, to make any sacrifice. But he was also aware that the means for achieving the goals have to be just, democratic and constitutional. This alone explains the evolution of his famous quote 'Lok Raj, Lok laj se chalta hai' A lofty goal can only be achieved through noble means, this is amply proved by his 72 years of work in public life.

Widely acclaimed as Vikas Purush of Haryana, Chaudhary Om Parkash Chautala comes of a famous political family of the country, having its roots in the village Chautala (Haryana) bordering the state of Rajasthan in India. He is the eldest son of Late Ch. Devi Lal, a veteran freedom fighter and affectionately known as Tau to one and all, whose illustrious political career culminated in his becoming the Deputy Prime Minister of the country in the year 1989.
Ajay Singh Chautala (b. 13 March 1961), son of Shri Om Prakash Chautala, Chief Minister, Haryana and grandson of Ch. Devi Lal, did his B.A. from Kurukshetra University, M.A. (Public Administration) and LL.B. from Rajasthan University. He joined active politics in 1980s, became MLA from Rajasthan twice: first from Data Ram Garh (1989) and then from Nauhar (1993). He becameMember of Parliament from Bhiwani Constituency. He is currently member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha). He became President of the Youth Wing of Indian National Lok Dal and secretary General of Indian National Lokdal Party.

Chaudhary Devi Lal was one of those first generation political leaders of the country who provided the link between the times of freedom struggle and times since achievement of Independence. With values imbibed during the freedom struggle, he relentlessly toiled for the welfare of the masses and rose to becoming Chief Minister of the State of Haryana and later Deputy Prime Minister of India.
Inspired by the ideals of the veterans of the freedom struggle like Lala Lajpat Rai andJawarharlal Nehru, he abandoned education rather early for fighting as a foot soldier against the British rulers. He was an active participant in Mahatma Gandhi's Civil Disobedience Movement. In the process, he spent more than four years of his early years of life in jail.
He strongly believed, and rightly so, that the peasantry is the backbone of India. Though he was himself the son of a big landlord, he was very keen on giving a fair deal to tenants and the labouring classes, especially the Dalits. He stood for enfranchisement oflands held on tenancy.
Chaudhary Devi Lal was also deeply inspired by the Ideals of Acharya Vinoba Bhave and participated in the Bhoodan Movement.
He stood for modernization of agriculture. He was a strong supporter of induction of: High Yielding Varieties technology, water conservation, energisation of agriculture and, most importantly, remunerative prices for farm produce. It was during his tenure as Deputy Prime Minister with charge of Agriculture portfolio that true beginnings were made for the establishment of the National Policy on Agriculture,
Rural development was close to his heart. As Deputy Prime Minister, he gave a new direction to the Planning process and called for significant enhancement of resource allocations for rural development. He wanted the cooperative movement to be strengthened too. In the true Gandhi an tradition, he urged for development of artisanal employments in the rural areas,
Chaudhary Devi Lal also wanted meaningful investments in education, especially in a manner relevant to employment for the youth. ""While he addressed the concerns of the youth in terms of education and skill development, he worked for the social security of the aged like through provision of Old Age Pensions.
He was one of the architects of the State of Haryana, the creation of which materialized in 1966. The features of the model of administration he believed in were balanced regional development, welfare and decentralization.
In politics, he was a true secularist. He abhorred involvement of business houses in politics and advised his followers to keep the business of politics outside the politics of business. He stood for probity and standards in public life,
He wanted the emergence of a strong 'third force' in politics and made his own contribution to this by the sheer dint of his personality. The manner in which he elegantly declined the position of the Prime Minister of the country in favour of Hon'ble Shri VP. Singh when he was unanimously elected as Leader of the Parliamentary Party in 1989 will go down in the annals ofIndia's political history as a rare and supreme example of selflessness.
Chaudhary Devi Lal was truly a national leader, even as his parliamentary career would reflect. When has was a member of Seventh Lok Sabha from 1980-1982, he represented Sonepat in Haryana. Second time over, when he was member of the Ninth Lok Sabha from 1989-1991, he had been returned from the State of Rajasthan, from the Sikar Parliamentary constituency.
Chaudhary Devi Lal, like Mahatma Gandhi himself, had the rare capability of totally identifying himself with the masses. The dress he wore, the food he ate, the language he spoke and the interests he unfailingly fought for were those of the masses.
This work gives rare insights into the making, thoughts and deeds of one of the greatest sons of India.

Former Prime Minister of India

I am happy to learn that a book under the title 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out. Chaudhary Sahib was not only tall in physical personality, but also in fighting for the cause of poor, oppressed and the depressed.
Chaudhary Devi Lal's philosophy had two main objectives. One was to attain the Independence for his country, which he loved very intensely. He contributed his mite to this by participating in the freedom struggle. The second objective was to struggle without rest or waiting for the emancipation of poor, downtrodden and farmers. He firmly believed that to remove poverty and to make poor to live a dignified life, Agriculture has to be inevitably developed. Though born in a family of Landlords, he campaigned for the cause of tenants and labourers. He firmly believed that, without improving Agriculture and the poor farmers who are engaged in it, it is just impossible to achieve over-all economic development and to remove poverty.
His whole life was a continuous struggle, without compromising, for improving the conditions of farmers and agriculture. In this aspect, Chaudhary Devi Lal's is a shining model inspiring all of us forever.
He had occupied the high post of Deputy Prime Minister of India declining to become the Prime Minister. During his tenure as Chief Minister of Haryana, the State witnessed unparalleled development in rural, social and industrial infrastructural sectors.
I am confident that the book that is being brought out will continue to inspire the future generations in regard to his love for the country, farmers and agriculture.
I wish the Chief Editor of this book, Shri Ajay Singh Chautala, Member of Parliament, all success in his efforts to make the book a memorable one.




Chandra Shekhar Former Prime Minister of India
I am happy to know that a book on 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out on the former Deputy Prime Minister of India. Ch. Devi Lal, a veteran Freedom Fighter, a man of masses and champion of Kisans has left an indelible mark on the history of our country. He was one of the titans produced by Freedom Movement. In the initial years of Independence, he fought many battles. At the time of re-organisation of States he raised his voice for a separate State of Haryana and launched massive movement against the Chief Ministers of Punjab, Shri Pratap Singh Kairon and Shri Bhim Sen Sachar and his role in the formation of present State of Haryana is significant. Chaudhary Devi Lal was one of the architects of Haryana for making it a front ranking state of the Country. He was a leader of national stature, who had undergone many ups and downs in his political career. Like a true villager, he spoke what he thought but his sincerity and conviction in pursuing his cherished goal of upliftment of village community cannot be doubted. He sought to give primacy to agriculture in India's socio-economic life. He championed the cause of rural poor and peasants at every stage.
His contribution to nation-building particularly at the grass root level and as Deputy Prime Minister in my Ministry can not be over emphasized. He played an important crucial role in determining the direction of agricultural development and rural uplift.
As Haryana Chief Minister, he took several measures for Agricultural growth as also for the welfare of rural community, such as Old Age Pension Scheme for which he is popularly known as Tau and respected.
I was closely associated with him since the days of Emergency. As Chief Minister of State of Haryana his role to promote and to bring recognition to the village life, the craftsmen and the farmers will always be remembered.
As Deputy Prime Minister in my Cabinet he took many measures for agricultural development.
It is hoped that the younger generation would take inspiration from his ideals to which he stood firm and worked for uplift of rural community despite differences with the concept of urban elite.





Parkash Singh Badal Former Chief Minister, Punjab
It gives me immense pleasure to know that a book on 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out on Ch. Devi Lal, former Deputy Prime Minister of India and a multi-dimensional personality. Jan Nayak Chaudhary Devi Lal was a legendary, towering figure, a tireless crusader and the massiah of common people fondly remembered as 'Tau'. During his long social and political career, he had always adhered to the values of secularism and humanism and championed the cause of the weak. He lived a principled life and kept the people's interest uppermost in mind than self. He raised his irrepressible voice against excesses on the 'have nots' and launched various revolutionary schemes which are still benefiting lakhs of people. The laudable contribution of Chaudhry Sahib during the dark days of emergency for restoring democratic rights to the people and freedom of the Press will be ever remembered.
Ch. Devi Lal was indeed a man of the masses. The effort of bringing out book on life and works of Chaudhary Sahib is indeed laudable and I wish it all success.





Dr. Farooq Abdullah
It's quite in place that we recall that great 'Tau' of Indianpolity who stayed as a leading light in the country's political firmament for over four decades. Chaudhry Devi Lal - the very name evokes reminiscences of a blunt, plain spoken, towering, even domineering personality. The aura of his out-reaching honesty and incorrigible ingenuity would, in fact, be lost on no one who ever came across him. He spurned office and shunned authority for his austere and egalitarian moorings. Even as Jat peasantry was his main forte, the great Chaudhry did not dwell in caste or communal moulds. I only wish the genre of politicians today to imbibe and emulate such views and values.



Naveen Patnaik Chief Minister, Orissa
It gives me immense pleasure to learn that a book on the veteran leader Chaudhary Devi Lal entitled as 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is going to be published shortly.
Chaudhary Devi Lal was a leader of the masses. He had devoted his entire life for the development of rural India. He had all along been espousing the cause of the peasants, the poor and the down-trodden. His concern for the development of agriculture and rural economy is well known. Chaudhary Devi Lal was a great patriot and freedom fighter and a good friend of Biju Babu.
I pay my respectful homage to this great personality of our country and wish the publication all success.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE
Ch. Devi Lal's life and work were devoted to the service of peasants, the poor and the under-privileged. He gave all he had to them and did not expect anything in return. He emerged from the backwaters of Haryana, born in a traditional family, broke all traditions, set new standards in public life, gave a new identity to rural masses and a new direction to the country's policy makers. He was a mature politician, a popular leader, an efficient administrator and a good human being. Those who did not come in contact with him and the future generations need to be told that a man like him did live in flesh and blood. This is a fascinating story.
And who are the persons to tell this story? Who else but those who have known him from close quarters, who have watched his life being shaped and influenced by the environment he lived in and have seen him working in his own typical style to leave a mark on the minds of the masses. That the first piece should have come from his son, Haryana Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala, is only natural. Ch. Om Prakash was very dear to him and was groomed by him to take to his ways and style. Nobody else could have known Ch. Devi Lal as intimately as he did, both in personal and public life. That the second chapter should have been written by me, Ch. Devi Lal's grandson, is also no surprise as I had also followed his later years' work keenly and closely. It is said that the generation gap disappears between family elders and their grandchildren and that they interact more freely and frankly than is possible between two consecutive generations.
What follows is the narration of a story in different parts by educationists and agricultural experts who have studied Ch. Devi Lal's life, work and philosophy as keen students of the politics and public life in the region. Some of them like Dr. S. S.Johl, Ch. Sultan Singh, Dr. K. L.Johar, Sh. A. L. Chaudhary, Dr. Harswarup Singh and Dr. P. S. Lamba had come in personal contact with him in working life. Others like Prof. K. C. Yadav, Prof. Hoshiar Singh, Prof. H. L. Verma, Sh. D. K. Kasnia, Dr. Hawa Singh, Dr. Rajpal Singh, Prof. S. D. Chambola, Prof. C. P. Malik and Dr. P. K. Vasudeva have made a scholarly study of his life and times to relate his story to that of the times. Some others like Prof. Sher Singh, Ch. Abhay Singh Chautala, Sh. S. N. Malik, Sh. S. P. Goel, Sh. Ashok Gupta, Monalisa Studio, Hisar and Sh. R. K. Khullar also deserve appreciations for their contribution and support in the preparation of this book.
There is a large variety of subjects-his role in freedom struggle, peasants' and tenants' movements, direction to agriculture policy, contribution towards uplift of the poor and the backward, creation of Haryana state, view of new fields like biotechnology and WTO, passion for nation-building and compassion for the non-elite sections of society. Some events in his life, some traits of his personality and some points of his philosophy may have been repeated but it is only to emphasise them. Also, when different persons are looking at him, they have different interpretations for them.
That such a book should have come so late, after his departure from the scene, is surprising. He would not know what others thought about him but, then, he was so different. He did not react to what others said about him. He went about working for causes dear to him unmindful of how others would take it. The fact is that his life, work and philosophy were over-looked by the intellectuals and the elitist, vocal sections of the society whose comments and opinions on public figures and public issues would make all the difference to resolve and determination of a person to carry on his mission or give up on the way. Not that it would have made a big difference to Ch. Devi Lal who had a one track mind when it came to serving the people. It is only proper that some of the intellectuals have thought of making a serious study about the man and his achievements and gave me the privilege of editing their thoughtful articles and presenting them in a book form. It would be only a part of what was due to Ch. Devi Lal. Perhaps it will mark the beginning of a series of books on him-there can be an independent book on each of his major activities and the ideas behind it.
Different chapters in this book narrate some of his life story and discuss his thinking on various subjects as well as translation of his ideas into practical campaigns and crusades on ground. Whether he felt the need to agitate against the British rulers compelling them to free Indian nation from the shackles of slavery or the need to campaign against their Indian successors for getting a better deal for the oppressed and deprived sections of society, he exerted to the maximum of his strength and resources to achieve his objective. Given his physical and mental strength and the mood of the youth in his early life, he could have become a revolutionary like Sardar Bhagat Singh and his comrades whom he adored. But he opted for Mahatma Gandhi's non-violent ways of agitation. He stuck to them till the last.
As the various chapters of this book unfold different aspects of his multi-facet, multi-dimension personality, the word compassion is repeated by more than one contributors, it is natural because this was the very basic quality, which nobody could have missed noticing in his life and work. He cared for human values, had a consideration for the suffering and woes of the common man. He was sensitive to all that he observed around him and wanted to do something for all, something that would answer their questions and solve their problems. What is more, he loved them all and had a large extended family. Be it his family, his clan, his followers, his countrymen, friends and foes alike, he was keen to serve them all without discrimination and to make this place better to live for not anyone section but for all sections of society. He forgave those clever politicians who considered him a novice and tried to take advantage of his simplicity and smooth sophistication which goes with the politics of the day. He did not mind the superiority complex of the bureaucrats and intellectual elite who he impressed ultimately with his sincerity of purpose and simple solutions to complex problems. He was unmindful even of the smart guys in the media who sometimes made fun of his rustic ways. In fact, he had the best of relations with the newspapermen all his life, whether he was in power or in opposition. Even while in opposition, he was respectful of the media. He could not throw lavish parties at his press conferences but made it up by bringing melons from village in his own car for his press friends. He respected the talent and experience of senior officials but would not let them take him for a ride. He was very considerate to his juniors and small employees too. Those who worked for him in any capacity enjoyed the assignment. In fact, they loved and respected the grand old man. This much for his human relations, all because he loved all human beings! A lot more can be said in this strain. It can be an unending story about the legend that Ch Devi Lal came to be for the people. This book is the beginning of that story.
To compile this book was not an easy task as it involved too much of academic work and commitment of time. For a person like me having a lot of other public engagements sparing time was perhaps the most difficult thing. But inner motivation and encouragement from my family could help to achieve this goal. I would like to place on record my appreciations for all the contributors of the papers and others who remained associated in the preparation of the book. All my well wishers and friends also deserve my special thanks for their cooperation and encouragement in this endeavour.

REMINISCENCES OF A SON
Om Prakash Chautala
How does one remember the life and work of a man, who, as father, taught you the rudiments of life, but never belonged to you fully since he was part of a larger world, also responsible for the well being of all others around him. Nevertheless, I have had the privilege of having an intimate peep into the character and personality of my father Ch. Devi Lal, both as a son as well as one of his most devoted followers in public life. If he taught me how to conduct myself in the family as a child, he also taught me to rise above narrow personal and sectional interests and develop a balanced and humanitarian overview of life.
I must confess that when I first became conscious of the world around me, I was a little perplexed that my father did not lead the normal life like others. There would be moments when I wished my father entirely to myself, like all other children. And yet, my mother's prompting and some deep instinct instructed my very impressionable and young mind that my father was no ordinary human being, and that if he was devoting less attention to me and others in the family, it was because he had to accomplish some other more important tasks. Soon I was to learn that though I was his eldest son, his affection was for a large number of children and people. Rarely did I feel the pangs of jealousy. On the contrary, I always felt elated at the realization that everyone vied for the attention of my father! Those were by all means proud and happy moments of my childhood.
The life and work of Ch. Devi Lal can easily be divided and analysed in three phases, each one more significant and momentous than the other. The first phase, based on the memories and narrations of others, deals with the period before the country's independence. The second phase of his life concerns a period of 30 years beginning with India's independence, and deals with his uninterrupted and uncompromising struggle for securing justice for the people and the region that is now Haryana. The third phase begins with 1977 when he first adorned the office of the Chief Minister of Haryana, a period of governance which was genuinely devoted to creating a modern welfare state, a model for other states.

CALL OF THE MAHATMA
Commitment and dedication to his chosen cause was a hallmark of his character right from his childhood. It was this dedication which made him drop out of the school so that he could respond to the call of Mahatma Gandhi and work as a humble soldier in the freedom struggle. He was deeply influenced by the likes of Lala Lajpat Rai, Martyr Bhagat Singh and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. These leaders, specially their philosophies of life influenced Ch. Devi Lal, and taught him to be ever willing to make any sacrifice when the occasion demanded. They also reinforced his inherent belief in truthfulness, commitment to noble causes and strengthened and intensified his empathy for the poor and the down-trodden.
By the time India attained independence, Ch. Devi Lal had already made his mark as a fearless leader, who could swim against the current if it brought justice to the poor. In 1946, he led the movement for the ownership rights of the tenants, and even in the face of opposition from his own family, he succeeded in bestowing ownership rights to the tenants. Life started looking up slowly but inevitably for the small farmers and the landless.
The second phase of his life marks a period of intense struggle, when under-privileged human beings would have felt intimidated by the disillusionment, frustration and exasperation at not being able to undo a wrong. And yet, unmindful of the setbacks and frequent betrayals by his friends and followers, he went ahead, making the poor, the backward and the farmers aware of their rights and just expectations from the state. This period is indebted to him because his efforts resulted in making the republican spirit of the Indian Constitution an integral part of our life.
This period also marks the creation of the state of Haryana. In an era when the presence of the Congress at the Centre and in the states made it impossible for the Congressmen to express dissent even on matters of high moral principles, Ch. Devi Lal showed exceptional courage in bringing out repeatedly facts and figures both in the Punjab Assembly and outside, to expose the prejudices and blatant injustice against those Hindi-speaking regions of Punjab which now constitute Haryana. It was Ch. Devi Lal's continuous crusade against injustice perpetrated by the then rulers of Punjab that finally resulted in the creation of a state where socio-economic aspirations of the Haryanavis could be realized.

MIDAS TOUCH
This was also a period when I came out of the confines of the home and became an integrated member of his large, extended family. It was then that I began my real education not only in the field of politics, but also in the affairs of humanity, where compassion and empathy were the primary lessons. His organizational skills were unmatched, and his man-management excellent. But what made him stand much above the rest of the leaders was his ability to make the lowly and the weak to aspire boldly for a better and a brighter future. He possessed the midas touch, and all those who came in contact with him went back with the realisation that they carried socio-political responsibility on their shoulders. Their weak shoulders became broad and stout the moment they exchanged a few words and shared their 'hooka' with Ch. Devi Lal.
This period is also memorable as the Prime Minister of the country made a determined attempt to trample democratic principles of the country, and the uncom promising response of the people to such fascist and dictatorial efforts. Not surprisingly, he was again in the forefront of this battle. This period is also significant since the farmers of the state had to wage persistent crusades for claiming their dues. The mantle of leadership for such movements was obviously to fall upon Ch. Devi Lal.

CREATIVE PHASE
The unequivocal verdict of the people of the country in general, and Haryana in particular, was delivered in the general elections to the Lok Sabha in 1977, and the democratic principles and sanctity of the constitution was restored. In the summer of the same year, general elections to the State Assembly were held and for the first time Ch. Devi Lal became Chief Minister of Haryana, thereby heralding his third and the most creative phase.
For the first time in modern era, the rural people in general and the farmers, the poor and the backward classes in particular, were made to feel that they were part of the decision-making process.
He became Chief Minister, again in 1987, and worked fiercely for the welfare of the masses, there were good results.
Thus, both his tenures were characterized by intense activity on the development front for the rural sector. If his first tenure was remembered for the reduction of interest on loans taken by farmers and labourers, the brick-lining of the water channels, implementation of matching grants for development of villages, the second is remembered for even more momentous decisions. In a historical decision, he freed the farmers, the backward classes and the small shopkeepers of the debt trap when their loans were waived. He also had an eye for the weakest in the society. That is why he offered a Rupee a day' scheme for the children of the nomadic tribes to draw them to schools and education. He also implemented a scheme to give financial assistance of Rs. 300 each to the women belonging to the Scheduled Caste at the time of child birth to enable them to have nutritious diet.
As I have mentioned already, I knew at a very young age that my father was not an ordinary person, and certainly not an ordinary father. I saw his fatherly image grow till it had under its wings the whole of the country. His paternal concern for all was well known, but it was his second term as Chief Minister which saw him evolve as 'Tau' of the society.

INDIVIDUAL’S DIGNITY
When he proclaimed old--age pension in Haryana, he acknowledged that the old and the infirm were entitled to dignity in their twilight years, and, that the state was duty bound to take care of those who had been laid low by age. In his concern for the old, he did not forget the young, who, though educated, were forced to ask for maintenance allowance from their families because of unemployment. He offered them token allowance and the privilege to travel free in public transport when going for an interview. History shows that there was a race among the rest of the states in the country to launch such welfare schemes. But Ch. Devi Lal was the first to have the sensitivity and the courage to admit that if there was no provision in the government budgets for such schemes, such a provision had to be made. This earned him the affectionate and respectful title of 'Tau' . It is a title that has come straight out of the hearts of the people across the length and breadth of the country, and is a result of the spontaneous expression of thanks.
He loved to be addressed as 'Tau', for he knew that this single household word had ensured a place for him in history. This perhaps explains his refusal to be the Prime Minister, though he was elected unanimously the Leader of the United Front Parliamentary Party. He said at that time that the people of the country address him as 'Tau', and he on his part preferred that role much more!
It is another matter that he became Deputy Prime Minister twice after that episode in 1989, but his concern for the farmers, the poor and the backward classes remained paramount always. In 1979, he had staked his office of Chief Minister by deciding to attend a farmers' rally being held to felicitate late Ch. Charan Singh; in 1990 he was again to stake everything for espousing the cause of the farmers while being in the VP.Singh government.
The cause or the issue was always greater than the office for him, and all his life he remained committed to the cause of the welfare of the farming community, and the issue of removal of poverty. For this he was ever willing to walk an extra mile, to make any sacrifice. But he was also aware that the means for achieving the goals have to be just, democratic and constitutional. This alone explains the evolution of his famous quote 'Lok Raj, Lok laj se chalta hai' A lofty goal can only be achieved through noble means, this is amply proved by his 72 years of work in public life.

Widely acclaimed as Vikas Purush of Haryana, Chaudhary Om Parkash Chautala comes of a famous political family of the country, having its roots in the village Chautala (Haryana) bordering the state of Rajasthan in India. He is the eldest son of Late Ch. Devi Lal, a veteran freedom fighter and affectionately known as Tau to one and all, whose illustrious political career culminated in his becoming the Deputy Prime Minister of the country in the year 1989.
Ajay Singh Chautala (b. 13 March 1961), son of Shri Om Prakash Chautala, Chief Minister, Haryana and grandson of Ch. Devi Lal, did his B.A. from Kurukshetra University, M.A. (Public Administration) and LL.B. from Rajasthan University. He joined active politics in 1980s, became MLA from Rajasthan twice: first from Data Ram Garh (1989) and then from Nauhar (1993). He becameMember of Parliament from Bhiwani Constituency. He is currently member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha). He became President of the Youth Wing of Indian National Lok Dal and secretary General of Indian National Lokdal Party.

Chaudhary Devi Lal was one of those first generation political leaders of the country who provided the link between the times of freedom struggle and times since achievement of Independence. With values imbibed during the freedom struggle, he relentlessly toiled for the welfare of the masses and rose to becoming Chief Minister of the State of Haryana and later Deputy Prime Minister of India.
Inspired by the ideals of the veterans of the freedom struggle like Lala Lajpat Rai andJawarharlal Nehru, he abandoned education rather early for fighting as a foot soldier against the British rulers. He was an active participant in Mahatma Gandhi's Civil Disobedience Movement. In the process, he spent more than four years of his early years of life in jail.
He strongly believed, and rightly so, that the peasantry is the backbone of India. Though he was himself the son of a big landlord, he was very keen on giving a fair deal to tenants and the labouring classes, especially the Dalits. He stood for enfranchisement oflands held on tenancy.
Chaudhary Devi Lal was also deeply inspired by the Ideals of Acharya Vinoba Bhave and participated in the Bhoodan Movement.
He stood for modernization of agriculture. He was a strong supporter of induction of: High Yielding Varieties technology, water conservation, energisation of agriculture and, most importantly, remunerative prices for farm produce. It was during his tenure as Deputy Prime Minister with charge of Agriculture portfolio that true beginnings were made for the establishment of the National Policy on Agriculture,
Rural development was close to his heart. As Deputy Prime Minister, he gave a new direction to the Planning process and called for significant enhancement of resource allocations for rural development. He wanted the cooperative movement to be strengthened too. In the true Gandhi an tradition, he urged for development of artisanal employments in the rural areas,
Chaudhary Devi Lal also wanted meaningful investments in education, especially in a manner relevant to employment for the youth. ""While he addressed the concerns of the youth in terms of education and skill development, he worked for the social security of the aged like through provision of Old Age Pensions.
He was one of the architects of the State of Haryana, the creation of which materialized in 1966. The features of the model of administration he believed in were balanced regional development, welfare and decentralization.
In politics, he was a true secularist. He abhorred involvement of business houses in politics and advised his followers to keep the business of politics outside the politics of business. He stood for probity and standards in public life,
He wanted the emergence of a strong 'third force' in politics and made his own contribution to this by the sheer dint of his personality. The manner in which he elegantly declined the position of the Prime Minister of the country in favour of Hon'ble Shri VP. Singh when he was unanimously elected as Leader of the Parliamentary Party in 1989 will go down in the annals ofIndia's political history as a rare and supreme example of selflessness.
Chaudhary Devi Lal was truly a national leader, even as his parliamentary career would reflect. When has was a member of Seventh Lok Sabha from 1980-1982, he represented Sonepat in Haryana. Second time over, when he was member of the Ninth Lok Sabha from 1989-1991, he had been returned from the State of Rajasthan, from the Sikar Parliamentary constituency.
Chaudhary Devi Lal, like Mahatma Gandhi himself, had the rare capability of totally identifying himself with the masses. The dress he wore, the food he ate, the language he spoke and the interests he unfailingly fought for were those of the masses.
This work gives rare insights into the making, thoughts and deeds of one of the greatest sons of India.

Former Prime Minister of India

I am happy to learn that a book under the title 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out. Chaudhary Sahib was not only tall in physical personality, but also in fighting for the cause of poor, oppressed and the depressed.
Chaudhary Devi Lal's philosophy had two main objectives. One was to attain the Independence for his country, which he loved very intensely. He contributed his mite to this by participating in the freedom struggle. The second objective was to struggle without rest or waiting for the emancipation of poor, downtrodden and farmers. He firmly believed that to remove poverty and to make poor to live a dignified life, Agriculture has to be inevitably developed. Though born in a family of Landlords, he campaigned for the cause of tenants and labourers. He firmly believed that, without improving Agriculture and the poor farmers who are engaged in it, it is just impossible to achieve over-all economic development and to remove poverty.
His whole life was a continuous struggle, without compromising, for improving the conditions of farmers and agriculture. In this aspect, Chaudhary Devi Lal's is a shining model inspiring all of us forever.
He had occupied the high post of Deputy Prime Minister of India declining to become the Prime Minister. During his tenure as Chief Minister of Haryana, the State witnessed unparalleled development in rural, social and industrial infrastructural sectors.
I am confident that the book that is being brought out will continue to inspire the future generations in regard to his love for the country, farmers and agriculture.
I wish the Chief Editor of this book, Shri Ajay Singh Chautala, Member of Parliament, all success in his efforts to make the book a memorable one.




Chandra Shekhar Former Prime Minister of India
I am happy to know that a book on 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out on the former Deputy Prime Minister of India. Ch. Devi Lal, a veteran Freedom Fighter, a man of masses and champion of Kisans has left an indelible mark on the history of our country. He was one of the titans produced by Freedom Movement. In the initial years of Independence, he fought many battles. At the time of re-organisation of States he raised his voice for a separate State of Haryana and launched massive movement against the Chief Ministers of Punjab, Shri Pratap Singh Kairon and Shri Bhim Sen Sachar and his role in the formation of present State of Haryana is significant. Chaudhary Devi Lal was one of the architects of Haryana for making it a front ranking state of the Country. He was a leader of national stature, who had undergone many ups and downs in his political career. Like a true villager, he spoke what he thought but his sincerity and conviction in pursuing his cherished goal of upliftment of village community cannot be doubted. He sought to give primacy to agriculture in India's socio-economic life. He championed the cause of rural poor and peasants at every stage.
His contribution to nation-building particularly at the grass root level and as Deputy Prime Minister in my Ministry can not be over emphasized. He played an important crucial role in determining the direction of agricultural development and rural uplift.
As Haryana Chief Minister, he took several measures for Agricultural growth as also for the welfare of rural community, such as Old Age Pension Scheme for which he is popularly known as Tau and respected.
I was closely associated with him since the days of Emergency. As Chief Minister of State of Haryana his role to promote and to bring recognition to the village life, the craftsmen and the farmers will always be remembered.
As Deputy Prime Minister in my Cabinet he took many measures for agricultural development.
It is hoped that the younger generation would take inspiration from his ideals to which he stood firm and worked for uplift of rural community despite differences with the concept of urban elite.





Parkash Singh Badal Former Chief Minister, Punjab
It gives me immense pleasure to know that a book on 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out on Ch. Devi Lal, former Deputy Prime Minister of India and a multi-dimensional personality. Jan Nayak Chaudhary Devi Lal was a legendary, towering figure, a tireless crusader and the massiah of common people fondly remembered as 'Tau'. During his long social and political career, he had always adhered to the values of secularism and humanism and championed the cause of the weak. He lived a principled life and kept the people's interest uppermost in mind than self. He raised his irrepressible voice against excesses on the 'have nots' and launched various revolutionary schemes which are still benefiting lakhs of people. The laudable contribution of Chaudhry Sahib during the dark days of emergency for restoring democratic rights to the people and freedom of the Press will be ever remembered.
Ch. Devi Lal was indeed a man of the masses. The effort of bringing out book on life and works of Chaudhary Sahib is indeed laudable and I wish it all success.





Dr. Farooq Abdullah
It's quite in place that we recall that great 'Tau' of Indianpolity who stayed as a leading light in the country's political firmament for over four decades. Chaudhry Devi Lal - the very name evokes reminiscences of a blunt, plain spoken, towering, even domineering personality. The aura of his out-reaching honesty and incorrigible ingenuity would, in fact, be lost on no one who ever came across him. He spurned office and shunned authority for his austere and egalitarian moorings. Even as Jat peasantry was his main forte, the great Chaudhry did not dwell in caste or communal moulds. I only wish the genre of politicians today to imbibe and emulate such views and values.



Naveen Patnaik Chief Minister, Orissa
It gives me immense pleasure to learn that a book on the veteran leader Chaudhary Devi Lal entitled as 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is going to be published shortly.
Chaudhary Devi Lal was a leader of the masses. He had devoted his entire life for the development of rural India. He had all along been espousing the cause of the peasants, the poor and the down-trodden. His concern for the development of agriculture and rural economy is well known. Chaudhary Devi Lal was a great patriot and freedom fighter and a good friend of Biju Babu.
I pay my respectful homage to this great personality of our country and wish the publication all success.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE
Ch. Devi Lal's life and work were devoted to the service of peasants, the poor and the under-privileged. He gave all he had to them and did not expect anything in return. He emerged from the backwaters of Haryana, born in a traditional family, broke all traditions, set new standards in public life, gave a new identity to rural masses and a new direction to the country's policy makers. He was a mature politician, a popular leader, an efficient administrator and a good human being. Those who did not come in contact with him and the future generations need to be told that a man like him did live in flesh and blood. This is a fascinating story.
And who are the persons to tell this story? Who else but those who have known him from close quarters, who have watched his life being shaped and influenced by the environment he lived in and have seen him working in his own typical style to leave a mark on the minds of the masses. That the first piece should have come from his son, Haryana Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala, is only natural. Ch. Om Prakash was very dear to him and was groomed by him to take to his ways and style. Nobody else could have known Ch. Devi Lal as intimately as he did, both in personal and public life. That the second chapter should have been written by me, Ch. Devi Lal's grandson, is also no surprise as I had also followed his later years' work keenly and closely. It is said that the generation gap disappears between family elders and their grandchildren and that they interact more freely and frankly than is possible between two consecutive generations.
What follows is the narration of a story in different parts by educationists and agricultural experts who have studied Ch. Devi Lal's life, work and philosophy as keen students of the politics and public life in the region. Some of them like Dr. S. S.Johl, Ch. Sultan Singh, Dr. K. L.Johar, Sh. A. L. Chaudhary, Dr. Harswarup Singh and Dr. P. S. Lamba had come in personal contact with him in working life. Others like Prof. K. C. Yadav, Prof. Hoshiar Singh, Prof. H. L. Verma, Sh. D. K. Kasnia, Dr. Hawa Singh, Dr. Rajpal Singh, Prof. S. D. Chambola, Prof. C. P. Malik and Dr. P. K. Vasudeva have made a scholarly study of his life and times to relate his story to that of the times. Some others like Prof. Sher Singh, Ch. Abhay Singh Chautala, Sh. S. N. Malik, Sh. S. P. Goel, Sh. Ashok Gupta, Monalisa Studio, Hisar and Sh. R. K. Khullar also deserve appreciations for their contribution and support in the preparation of this book.
There is a large variety of subjects-his role in freedom struggle, peasants' and tenants' movements, direction to agriculture policy, contribution towards uplift of the poor and the backward, creation of Haryana state, view of new fields like biotechnology and WTO, passion for nation-building and compassion for the non-elite sections of society. Some events in his life, some traits of his personality and some points of his philosophy may have been repeated but it is only to emphasise them. Also, when different persons are looking at him, they have different interpretations for them.
That such a book should have come so late, after his departure from the scene, is surprising. He would not know what others thought about him but, then, he was so different. He did not react to what others said about him. He went about working for causes dear to him unmindful of how others would take it. The fact is that his life, work and philosophy were over-looked by the intellectuals and the elitist, vocal sections of the society whose comments and opinions on public figures and public issues would make all the difference to resolve and determination of a person to carry on his mission or give up on the way. Not that it would have made a big difference to Ch. Devi Lal who had a one track mind when it came to serving the people. It is only proper that some of the intellectuals have thought of making a serious study about the man and his achievements and gave me the privilege of editing their thoughtful articles and presenting them in a book form. It would be only a part of what was due to Ch. Devi Lal. Perhaps it will mark the beginning of a series of books on him-there can be an independent book on each of his major activities and the ideas behind it.
Different chapters in this book narrate some of his life story and discuss his thinking on various subjects as well as translation of his ideas into practical campaigns and crusades on ground. Whether he felt the need to agitate against the British rulers compelling them to free Indian nation from the shackles of slavery or the need to campaign against their Indian successors for getting a better deal for the oppressed and deprived sections of society, he exerted to the maximum of his strength and resources to achieve his objective. Given his physical and mental strength and the mood of the youth in his early life, he could have become a revolutionary like Sardar Bhagat Singh and his comrades whom he adored. But he opted for Mahatma Gandhi's non-violent ways of agitation. He stuck to them till the last.
As the various chapters of this book unfold different aspects of his multi-facet, multi-dimension personality, the word compassion is repeated by more than one contributors, it is natural because this was the very basic quality, which nobody could have missed noticing in his life and work. He cared for human values, had a consideration for the suffering and woes of the common man. He was sensitive to all that he observed around him and wanted to do something for all, something that would answer their questions and solve their problems. What is more, he loved them all and had a large extended family. Be it his family, his clan, his followers, his countrymen, friends and foes alike, he was keen to serve them all without discrimination and to make this place better to live for not anyone section but for all sections of society. He forgave those clever politicians who considered him a novice and tried to take advantage of his simplicity and smooth sophistication which goes with the politics of the day. He did not mind the superiority complex of the bureaucrats and intellectual elite who he impressed ultimately with his sincerity of purpose and simple solutions to complex problems. He was unmindful even of the smart guys in the media who sometimes made fun of his rustic ways. In fact, he had the best of relations with the newspapermen all his life, whether he was in power or in opposition. Even while in opposition, he was respectful of the media. He could not throw lavish parties at his press conferences but made it up by bringing melons from village in his own car for his press friends. He respected the talent and experience of senior officials but would not let them take him for a ride. He was very considerate to his juniors and small employees too. Those who worked for him in any capacity enjoyed the assignment. In fact, they loved and respected the grand old man. This much for his human relations, all because he loved all human beings! A lot more can be said in this strain. It can be an unending story about the legend that Ch Devi Lal came to be for the people. This book is the beginning of that story.
To compile this book was not an easy task as it involved too much of academic work and commitment of time. For a person like me having a lot of other public engagements sparing time was perhaps the most difficult thing. But inner motivation and encouragement from my family could help to achieve this goal. I would like to place on record my appreciations for all the contributors of the papers and others who remained associated in the preparation of the book. All my well wishers and friends also deserve my special thanks for their cooperation and encouragement in this endeavour.

REMINISCENCES OF A SON
Om Prakash Chautala
How does one remember the life and work of a man, who, as father, taught you the rudiments of life, but never belonged to you fully since he was part of a larger world, also responsible for the well being of all others around him. Nevertheless, I have had the privilege of having an intimate peep into the character and personality of my father Ch. Devi Lal, both as a son as well as one of his most devoted followers in public life. If he taught me how to conduct myself in the family as a child, he also taught me to rise above narrow personal and sectional interests and develop a balanced and humanitarian overview of life.
I must confess that when I first became conscious of the world around me, I was a little perplexed that my father did not lead the normal life like others. There would be moments when I wished my father entirely to myself, like all other children. And yet, my mother's prompting and some deep instinct instructed my very impressionable and young mind that my father was no ordinary human being, and that if he was devoting less attention to me and others in the family, it was because he had to accomplish some other more important tasks. Soon I was to learn that though I was his eldest son, his affection was for a large number of children and people. Rarely did I feel the pangs of jealousy. On the contrary, I always felt elated at the realization that everyone vied for the attention of my father! Those were by all means proud and happy moments of my childhood.
The life and work of Ch. Devi Lal can easily be divided and analysed in three phases, each one more significant and momentous than the other. The first phase, based on the memories and narrations of others, deals with the period before the country's independence. The second phase of his life concerns a period of 30 years beginning with India's independence, and deals with his uninterrupted and uncompromising struggle for securing justice for the people and the region that is now Haryana. The third phase begins with 1977 when he first adorned the office of the Chief Minister of Haryana, a period of governance which was genuinely devoted to creating a modern welfare state, a model for other states.

CALL OF THE MAHATMA
Commitment and dedication to his chosen cause was a hallmark of his character right from his childhood. It was this dedication which made him drop out of the school so that he could respond to the call of Mahatma Gandhi and work as a humble soldier in the freedom struggle. He was deeply influenced by the likes of Lala Lajpat Rai, Martyr Bhagat Singh and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. These leaders, specially their philosophies of life influenced Ch. Devi Lal, and taught him to be ever willing to make any sacrifice when the occasion demanded. They also reinforced his inherent belief in truthfulness, commitment to noble causes and strengthened and intensified his empathy for the poor and the down-trodden.
By the time India attained independence, Ch. Devi Lal had already made his mark as a fearless leader, who could swim against the current if it brought justice to the poor. In 1946, he led the movement for the ownership rights of the tenants, and even in the face of opposition from his own family, he succeeded in bestowing ownership rights to the tenants. Life started looking up slowly but inevitably for the small farmers and the landless.
The second phase of his life marks a period of intense struggle, when under-privileged human beings would have felt intimidated by the disillusionment, frustration and exasperation at not being able to undo a wrong. And yet, unmindful of the setbacks and frequent betrayals by his friends and followers, he went ahead, making the poor, the backward and the farmers aware of their rights and just expectations from the state. This period is indebted to him because his efforts resulted in making the republican spirit of the Indian Constitution an integral part of our life.
This period also marks the creation of the state of Haryana. In an era when the presence of the Congress at the Centre and in the states made it impossible for the Congressmen to express dissent even on matters of high moral principles, Ch. Devi Lal showed exceptional courage in bringing out repeatedly facts and figures both in the Punjab Assembly and outside, to expose the prejudices and blatant injustice against those Hindi-speaking regions of Punjab which now constitute Haryana. It was Ch. Devi Lal's continuous crusade against injustice perpetrated by the then rulers of Punjab that finally resulted in the creation of a state where socio-economic aspirations of the Haryanavis could be realized.

MIDAS TOUCH
This was also a period when I came out of the confines of the home and became an integrated member of his large, extended family. It was then that I began my real education not only in the field of politics, but also in the affairs of humanity, where compassion and empathy were the primary lessons. His organizational skills were unmatched, and his man-management excellent. But what made him stand much above the rest of the leaders was his ability to make the lowly and the weak to aspire boldly for a better and a brighter future. He possessed the midas touch, and all those who came in contact with him went back with the realisation that they carried socio-political responsibility on their shoulders. Their weak shoulders became broad and stout the moment they exchanged a few words and shared their 'hooka' with Ch. Devi Lal.
This period is also memorable as the Prime Minister of the country made a determined attempt to trample democratic principles of the country, and the uncom promising response of the people to such fascist and dictatorial efforts. Not surprisingly, he was again in the forefront of this battle. This period is also significant since the farmers of the state had to wage persistent crusades for claiming their dues. The mantle of leadership for such movements was obviously to fall upon Ch. Devi Lal.

CREATIVE PHASE
The unequivocal verdict of the people of the country in general, and Haryana in particular, was delivered in the general elections to the Lok Sabha in 1977, and the democratic principles and sanctity of the constitution was restored. In the summer of the same year, general elections to the State Assembly were held and for the first time Ch. Devi Lal became Chief Minister of Haryana, thereby heralding his third and the most creative phase.
For the first time in modern era, the rural people in general and the farmers, the poor and the backward classes in particular, were made to feel that they were part of the decision-making process.
He became Chief Minister, again in 1987, and worked fiercely for the welfare of the masses, there were good results.
Thus, both his tenures were characterized by intense activity on the development front for the rural sector. If his first tenure was remembered for the reduction of interest on loans taken by farmers and labourers, the brick-lining of the water channels, implementation of matching grants for development of villages, the second is remembered for even more momentous decisions. In a historical decision, he freed the farmers, the backward classes and the small shopkeepers of the debt trap when their loans were waived. He also had an eye for the weakest in the society. That is why he offered a Rupee a day' scheme for the children of the nomadic tribes to draw them to schools and education. He also implemented a scheme to give financial assistance of Rs. 300 each to the women belonging to the Scheduled Caste at the time of child birth to enable them to have nutritious diet.
As I have mentioned already, I knew at a very young age that my father was not an ordinary person, and certainly not an ordinary father. I saw his fatherly image grow till it had under its wings the whole of the country. His paternal concern for all was well known, but it was his second term as Chief Minister which saw him evolve as 'Tau' of the society.

INDIVIDUAL’S DIGNITY
When he proclaimed old--age pension in Haryana, he acknowledged that the old and the infirm were entitled to dignity in their twilight years, and, that the state was duty bound to take care of those who had been laid low by age. In his concern for the old, he did not forget the young, who, though educated, were forced to ask for maintenance allowance from their families because of unemployment. He offered them token allowance and the privilege to travel free in public transport when going for an interview. History shows that there was a race among the rest of the states in the country to launch such welfare schemes. But Ch. Devi Lal was the first to have the sensitivity and the courage to admit that if there was no provision in the government budgets for such schemes, such a provision had to be made. This earned him the affectionate and respectful title of 'Tau' . It is a title that has come straight out of the hearts of the people across the length and breadth of the country, and is a result of the spontaneous expression of thanks.
He loved to be addressed as 'Tau', for he knew that this single household word had ensured a place for him in history. This perhaps explains his refusal to be the Prime Minister, though he was elected unanimously the Leader of the United Front Parliamentary Party. He said at that time that the people of the country address him as 'Tau', and he on his part preferred that role much more!
It is another matter that he became Deputy Prime Minister twice after that episode in 1989, but his concern for the farmers, the poor and the backward classes remained paramount always. In 1979, he had staked his office of Chief Minister by deciding to attend a farmers' rally being held to felicitate late Ch. Charan Singh; in 1990 he was again to stake everything for espousing the cause of the farmers while being in the VP.Singh government.
The cause or the issue was always greater than the office for him, and all his life he remained committed to the cause of the welfare of the farming community, and the issue of removal of poverty. For this he was ever willing to walk an extra mile, to make any sacrifice. But he was also aware that the means for achieving the goals have to be just, democratic and constitutional. This alone explains the evolution of his famous quote 'Lok Raj, Lok laj se chalta hai' A lofty goal can only be achieved through noble means, this is amply proved by his 72 years of work in public life.

Widely acclaimed as Vikas Purush of Haryana, Chaudhary Om Parkash Chautala comes of a famous political family of the country, having its roots in the village Chautala (Haryana) bordering the state of Rajasthan in India. He is the eldest son of Late Ch. Devi Lal, a veteran freedom fighter and affectionately known as Tau to one and all, whose illustrious political career culminated in his becoming the Deputy Prime Minister of the country in the year 1989.
Ajay Singh Chautala (b. 13 March 1961), son of Shri Om Prakash Chautala, Chief Minister, Haryana and grandson of Ch. Devi Lal, did his B.A. from Kurukshetra University, M.A. (Public Administration) and LL.B. from Rajasthan University. He joined active politics in 1980s, became MLA from Rajasthan twice: first from Data Ram Garh (1989) and then from Nauhar (1993). He becameMember of Parliament from Bhiwani Constituency. He is currently member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha). He became President of the Youth Wing of Indian National Lok Dal and secretary General of Indian National Lokdal Party.

Chaudhary Devi Lal was one of those first generation political leaders of the country who provided the link between the times of freedom struggle and times since achievement of Independence. With values imbibed during the freedom struggle, he relentlessly toiled for the welfare of the masses and rose to becoming Chief Minister of the State of Haryana and later Deputy Prime Minister of India.
Inspired by the ideals of the veterans of the freedom struggle like Lala Lajpat Rai andJawarharlal Nehru, he abandoned education rather early for fighting as a foot soldier against the British rulers. He was an active participant in Mahatma Gandhi's Civil Disobedience Movement. In the process, he spent more than four years of his early years of life in jail.
He strongly believed, and rightly so, that the peasantry is the backbone of India. Though he was himself the son of a big landlord, he was very keen on giving a fair deal to tenants and the labouring classes, especially the Dalits. He stood for enfranchisement oflands held on tenancy.
Chaudhary Devi Lal was also deeply inspired by the Ideals of Acharya Vinoba Bhave and participated in the Bhoodan Movement.
He stood for modernization of agriculture. He was a strong supporter of induction of: High Yielding Varieties technology, water conservation, energisation of agriculture and, most importantly, remunerative prices for farm produce. It was during his tenure as Deputy Prime Minister with charge of Agriculture portfolio that true beginnings were made for the establishment of the National Policy on Agriculture,
Rural development was close to his heart. As Deputy Prime Minister, he gave a new direction to the Planning process and called for significant enhancement of resource allocations for rural development. He wanted the cooperative movement to be strengthened too. In the true Gandhi an tradition, he urged for development of artisanal employments in the rural areas,
Chaudhary Devi Lal also wanted meaningful investments in education, especially in a manner relevant to employment for the youth. ""While he addressed the concerns of the youth in terms of education and skill development, he worked for the social security of the aged like through provision of Old Age Pensions.
He was one of the architects of the State of Haryana, the creation of which materialized in 1966. The features of the model of administration he believed in were balanced regional development, welfare and decentralization.
In politics, he was a true secularist. He abhorred involvement of business houses in politics and advised his followers to keep the business of politics outside the politics of business. He stood for probity and standards in public life,
He wanted the emergence of a strong 'third force' in politics and made his own contribution to this by the sheer dint of his personality. The manner in which he elegantly declined the position of the Prime Minister of the country in favour of Hon'ble Shri VP. Singh when he was unanimously elected as Leader of the Parliamentary Party in 1989 will go down in the annals ofIndia's political history as a rare and supreme example of selflessness.
Chaudhary Devi Lal was truly a national leader, even as his parliamentary career would reflect. When has was a member of Seventh Lok Sabha from 1980-1982, he represented Sonepat in Haryana. Second time over, when he was memeber of the Ninth Lok Sabha from 1989-1991, he had been returned from the State of Rajasthan, from the Sikar Parliamentary constituency.
Chaudhary Devi Lal, like Mahatma Gandhi himself, had the rare capability of totally identifying himself with the masses. The dress he wore, the food he ate, the language he spoke and the interests he unfailingly fought for were those of the masses.
This work gives rare insights into the making, thoughts and deeds of one of the greatest sons of India.

Krishan Kant Former Vice-President of India
I am happy to know that a book edited by Shri Ajay Singh Chautala, M.P. titled 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out, commemorating his multifaceted contributions to the country. Chaudhary Devi Lal was one of the prominent leaders during India's struggle for Independence as well as in the post-independence politics.

Former Prime Minister of India

I am happy to learn that a book under the title 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out. Chaudhary Sahib was not only tall in physical personality, but also in fighting for the cause of poor, oppressed and the depressed.
Chaudhary Devi Lal's philosophy had two main objectives. One was to attain the Independence for his country, which he loved very intensely. He contributed his mite to this by participating in the freedom struggle. The second objective was to struggle without rest or waiting for the emancipation of poor, downtrodden and farmers. He firmly believed that to remove poverty and to make poor to live a dignified life, Agriculture has to be inevitably developed. Though born in a family of Landlords, he campaigned for the cause of tenants and labourers. He firmly believed that, without improving Agriculture and the poor farmers who are engaged in it, it is just impossible to achieve over-all economic development and to remove poverty.
His whole life was a continuous struggle, without compromising, for improving the conditions of farmers and agriculture. In this aspect, Chaudhary Devi Lal's is a shining model inspiring all of us forever.
He had occupied the high post of Deputy Prime Minister of India declining to become the Prime Minister. During his tenure as Chief Minister of Haryana, the State witnessed unparalleled development in rural, social and industrial infrastructural sectors.
I am confident that the book that is being brought out will continue to inspire the future generations in regard to his love for the country, farmers and agriculture.
I wish the Chief Editor of this book, Shri Ajay Singh Chautala, Member of Parliament, all success in his efforts to make the book a memorable one.




Chandra Shekhar Former Prime Minister of India
I am happy to know that a book on 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out on the former Deputy Prime Minister of India. Ch. Devi Lal, a veteran Freedom Fighter, a man of masses and champion of Kisans has left an indelible mark on the history of our country. He was one of the titans produced by Freedom Movement. In the initial years of Independence, he fought many battles. At the time of re-organisation of States he raised his voice for a separate State of Haryana and launched massive movement against the Chief Ministers of Punjab, Shri Pratap Singh Kairon and Shri Bhim Sen Sachar and his role in the formation of present State of Haryana is significant. Chaudhary Devi Lal was one of the architects of Haryana for making it a front ranking state of the Country. He was a leader of national stature, who had undergone many ups and downs in his political career. Like a true villager, he spoke what he thought but his sincerity and conviction in pursuing his cherished goal of upliftment of village community cannot be doubted. He sought to give primacy to agriculture in India's socio-economic life. He championed the cause of rural poor and peasants at every stage.
His contribution to nation-building particularly at the grass root level and as Deputy Prime Minister in my Ministry can not be over emphasized. He played an important crucial role in determining the direction of agricultural development and rural uplift.
As Haryana Chief Minister, he took several measures for Agricultural growth as also for the welfare of rural community, such as Old Age Pension Scheme for which he is popularly known as Tau and respected.
I was closely associated with him since the days of Emergency. As Chief Minister of State of Haryana his role to promote and to bring recognition to the village life, the craftsmen and the farmers will always be remembered.
As Deputy Prime Minister in my Cabinet he took many measures for agricultural development.
It is hoped that the younger generation would take inspiration from his ideals to which he stood firm and worked for uplift of rural community despite differences with the concept of urban elite.





Parkash Singh Badal Former Chief Minister, Punjab
It gives me immense pleasure to know that a book on 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out on Ch. Devi Lal, former Deputy Prime Minister of India and a multi-dimensional personality. Jan Nayak Chaudhary Devi Lal was a legendary, towering figure, a tireless crusader and the massiah of common people fondly remembered as 'Tau'. During his long social and political career, he had always adhered to the values of secularism and humanism and championed the cause of the weak. He lived a principled life and kept the people's interest uppermost in mind than self. He raised his irrepressible voice against excesses on the 'have nots' and launched various revolutionary schemes which are still benefiting lakhs of people. The laudable contribution of Chaudhry Sahib during the dark days of emergency for restoring democratic rights to the people and freedom of the Press will be ever remembered.
Ch. Devi Lal was indeed a man of the masses. The effort of bringing out book on life and works of Chaudhary Sahib is indeed laudable and I wish it all success.

It's quite in place that we recall that great 'Tau' of Indianpolity who stayed as a leading light in the country's political firmament for over four decades. Chaudhry Devi Lal - the very name evokes reminiscences of a blunt, plain spoken, towering, even domineering personality. The aura of his out-reaching honesty and incorrigible ingenuity would, in fact, be lost on no one who ever came across him. He spurned office and shunned authority for his austere and egalitarian moorings. Even as Jat peasantry was his main forte, the great Chaudhry did not dwell in caste or communal moulds. I only wish the genre of politicians today to imbibe and emulate such views and values.



Naveen Patnaik Chief Minister, Orissa
It gives me immense pleasure to learn that a book on the veteran leader Chaudhary Devi Lal entitled as 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is going to be published shortly.
Chaudhary Devi Lal was a leader of the masses. He had devoted his entire life for the development of rural India. He had all along been espousing the cause of the peasants, the poor and the down-trodden. His concern for the development of agriculture and rural economy is well known. Chaudhary Devi Lal was a great patriot and freedom fighter and a good friend of Biju Babu.
I pay my respectful homage to this great personality of our country and wish the publication all success.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE
Ch. Devi Lal's life and work were devoted to the service of peasants, the poor and the under-privileged. He gave all he had to them and did not expect anything in return. He emerged from the backwaters of Haryana, born in a traditional family, broke all traditions, set new standards in public life, gave a new identity to rural masses and a new direction to the country's policy makers. He was a mature politician, a popular leader, an efficient administrator and a good human being. Those who did not come in contact with him and the future generations need to be told that a man like him did live in flesh and blood. This is a fascinating story.
And who are the persons to tell this story? Who else but those who have known him from close quarters, who have watched his life being shaped and influenced by the environment he lived in and have seen him working in his own typical style to leave a mark on the minds of the masses. That the first piece should have come from his son, Haryana Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala, is only natural. Ch. Om Prakash was very dear to him and was groomed by him to take to his ways and style. Nobody else could have known Ch. Devi Lal as intimately as he did, both in personal and public life. That the second chapter should have been written by me, Ch. Devi Lal's grandson, is also no surprise as I had also followed his later years' work keenly and closely. It is said that the generation gap disappears between family elders and their grandchildren and that they interact more freely and frankly than is possible between two consecutive generations.
What follows is the narration of a story in different parts by educationists and agricultural experts who have studied Ch. Devi Lal's life, work and philosophy as keen students of the politics and public life in the region. Some of them like Dr. S. S.Johl, Ch. Sultan Singh, Dr. K. L.Johar, Sh. A. L. Chaudhary, Dr. Harswarup Singh and Dr. P. S. Lamba had come in personal contact with him in working life. Others like Prof. K. C. Yadav, Prof. Hoshiar Singh, Prof. H. L. Verma, Sh. D. K. Kasnia, Dr. Hawa Singh, Dr. Rajpal Singh, Prof. S. D. Chambola, Prof. C. P. Malik and Dr. P. K. Vasudeva have made a scholarly study of his life and times to relate his story to that of the times. Some others like Prof. Sher Singh, Ch. Abhay Singh Chautala, Sh. S. N. Malik, Sh. S. P. Goel, Sh. Ashok Gupta, Monalisa Studio, Hisar and Sh. R. K. Khullar also deserve appreciations for their contribution and support in the preparation of this book.
There is a large variety of subjects-his role in freedom struggle, peasants' and tenants' movements, direction to agriculture policy, contribution towards uplift of the poor and the backward, creation of Haryana state, view of new fields like biotechnology and WTO, passion for nation-building and compassion for the non-elite sections of society. Some events in his life, some traits of his personality and some points of his philosophy may have been repeated but it is only to emphasise them. Also, when different persons are looking at him, they have different interpretations for them.
That such a book should have come so late, after his departure from the scene, is surprising. He would not know what others thought about him but, then, he was so different. He did not react to what others said about him. He went about working for causes dear to him unmindful of how others would take it. The fact is that his life, work and philosophy were over-looked by the intellectuals and the elitist, vocal sections of the society whose comments and opinions on public figures and public issues would make all the difference to resolve and determination of a person to carry on his mission or give up on the way. Not that it would have made a big difference to Ch. Devi Lal who had a one track mind when it came to serving the people. It is only proper that some of the intellectuals have thought of making a serious study about the man and his achievements and gave me the privilege of editing their thoughtful articles and presenting them in a book form. It would be only a part of what was due to Ch. Devi Lal. Perhaps it will mark the beginning of a series of books on him-there can be an independent book on each of his major activities and the ideas behind it.
Different chapters in this book narrate some of his life story and discuss his thinking on various subjects as well as translation of his ideas into practical campaigns and crusades on ground. Whether he felt the need to agitate against the British rulers compelling them to free Indian nation from the shackles of slavery or the need to campaign against their Indian successors for getting a better deal for the oppressed and deprived sections of society, he exerted to the maximum of his strength and resources to achieve his objective. Given his physical and mental strength and the mood of the youth in his early life, he could have become a revolutionary like Sardar Bhagat Singh and his comrades whom he adored. But he opted for Mahatma Gandhi's non-violent ways of agitation. He stuck to them till the last.
As the various chapters of this book unfold different aspects of his multi-facet, multi-dimension personality, the word compassion is repeated by more than one contributors, it is natural because this was the very basic quality, which nobody could have missed noticing in his life and work. He cared for human values, had a consideration for the suffering and woes of the common man. He was sensitive to all that he observed around him and wanted to do something for all, something that would answer their questions and solve their problems. What is more, he loved them all and had a large extended family. Be it his family, his clan, his followers, his countrymen, friends and foes alike, he was keen to serve them all without discrimination and to make this place better to live for not anyone section but for all sections of society. He forgave those clever politicians who considered him a novice and tried to take advantage of his simplicity and smooth sophistication which goes with the politics of the day. He did not mind the superiority complex of the bureaucrats and intellectual elite who he impressed ultimately with his sincerity of purpose and simple solutions to complex problems. He was unmindful even of the smart guys in the media who sometimes made fun of his rustic ways. In fact, he had the best of relations with the newspapermen all his life, whether he was in power or in opposition. Even while in opposition, he was respectful of the media. He could not throw lavish parties at his press conferences but made it up by bringing melons from village in his own car for his press friends. He respected the talent and experience of senior officials but would not let them take him for a ride. He was very considerate to his juniors and small employees too. Those who worked for him in any capacity enjoyed the assignment. In fact, they loved and respected the grand old man. This much for his human relations, all because he loved all human beings! A lot more can be said in this strain. It can be an unending story about the legend that Ch Devi Lal came to be for the people. This book is the beginning of that story.
To compile this book was not an easy task as it involved too much of academic work and commitment of time. For a person like me having a lot of other public engagements sparing time was perhaps the most difficult thing. But inner motivation and encouragement from my family could help to achieve this goal. I would like to place on record my appreciations for all the contributors of the papers and others who remained associated in the preparation of the book. All my well wishers and friends also deserve my special thanks for their cooperation and encouragement in this endeavour.

REMINISCENCES OF A SON
Om Prakash Chautala
How does one remember the life and work of a man, who, as father, taught you the rudiments of life, but never belonged to you fully since he was part of a larger world, also responsible for the well being of all others around him. Nevertheless, I have had the privilege of having an intimate peep into the character and personality of my father Ch. Devi Lal, both as a son as well as one of his most devoted followers in public life. If he taught me how to conduct myself in the family as a child, he also taught me to rise above narrow personal and sectional interests and develop a balanced and humanitarian overview of life.
I must confess that when I first became conscious of the world around me, I was a little perplexed that my father did not lead the normal life like others. There would be moments when I wished my father entirely to myself, like all other children. And yet, my mother's prompting and some deep instinct instructed my very impressionable and young mind that my father was no ordinary human being, and that if he was devoting less attention to me and others in the family, it was because he had to accomplish some other more important tasks. Soon I was to learn that though I was his eldest son, his affection was for a large number of children and people. Rarely did I feel the pangs of jealousy. On the contrary, I always felt elated at the realization that everyone vied for the attention of my father! Those were by all means proud and happy moments of my childhood.
The life and work of Ch. Devi Lal can easily be divided and analysed in three phases, each one more significant and momentous than the other. The first phase, based on the memories and narrations of others, deals with the period before the country's independence. The second phase of his life concerns a period of 30 years beginning with India's independence, and deals with his uninterrupted and uncompromising struggle for securing justice for the people and the region that is now Haryana. The third phase begins with 1977 when he first adorned the office of the Chief Minister of Haryana, a period of governance which was genuinely devoted to creating a modern welfare state, a model for other states.

CALL OF THE MAHATMA
Commitment and dedication to his chosen cause was a hallmark of his character right from his childhood. It was this dedication which made him drop out of the school so that he could respond to the call of Mahatma Gandhi and work as a humble soldier in the freedom struggle. He was deeply influenced by the likes of Lala Lajpat Rai, Martyr Bhagat Singh and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. These leaders, specially their philosophies of life influenced Ch. Devi Lal, and taught him to be ever willing to make any sacrifice when the occasion demanded. They also reinforced his inherent belief in truthfulness, commitment to noble causes and strengthened and intensified his empathy for the poor and the down-trodden.
By the time India attained independence, Ch. Devi Lal had already made his mark as a fearless leader, who could swim against the current if it brought justice to the poor. In 1946, he led the movement for the ownership rights of the tenants, and even in the face of opposition from his own family, he succeeded in bestowing ownership rights to the tenants. Life started looking up slowly but inevitably for the small farmers and the landless.
The second phase of his life marks a period of intense struggle, when under-privileged human beings would have felt intimidated by the disillusionment, frustration and exasperation at not being able to undo a wrong. And yet, unmindful of the setbacks and frequent betrayals by his friends and followers, he went ahead, making the poor, the backward and the farmers aware of their rights and just expectations from the state. This period is indebted to him because his efforts resulted in making the republican spirit of the Indian Constitution an integral part of our life.
This period also marks the creation of the state of Haryana. In an era when the presence of the Congress at the Centre and in the states made it impossible for the Congressmen to express dissent even on matters of high moral principles, Ch. Devi Lal showed exceptional courage in bringing out repeatedly facts and figures both in the Punjab Assembly and outside, to expose the prejudices and blatant injustice against those Hindi-speaking regions of Punjab which now constitute Haryana. It was Ch. Devi Lal's continuous crusade against injustice perpetrated by the then rulers of Punjab that finally resulted in the creation of a state where socio-economic aspirations of the Haryanavis could be realized.

MIDAS TOUCH
This was also a period when I came out of the confines of the home and became an integrated member of his large, extended family. It was then that I began my real education not only in the field of politics, but also in the affairs of humanity, where compassion and empathy were the primary lessons. His organizational skills were unmatched, and his man-management excellent. But what made him stand much above the rest of the leaders was his ability to make the lowly and the weak to aspire boldly for a better and a brighter future. He possessed the midas touch, and all those who came in contact with him went back with the realisation that they carried socio-political responsibility on their shoulders. Their weak shoulders became broad and stout the moment they exchanged a few words and shared their 'hooka' with Ch. Devi Lal.
This period is also memorable as the Prime Minister of the country made a determined attempt to trample democratic principles of the country, and the uncom promising response of the people to such fascist and dictatorial efforts. Not surprisingly, he was again in the forefront of this battle. This period is also significant since the farmers of the state had to wage persistent crusades for claiming their dues. The mantle of leadership for such movements was obviously to fall upon Ch. Devi Lal.

CREATIVE PHASE
The unequivocal verdict of the people of the country in general, and Haryana in particular, was delivered in the general elections to the Lok Sabha in 1977, and the democratic principles and sanctity of the constitution was restored. In the summer of the same year, general elections to the State Assembly were held and for the first time Ch. Devi Lal became Chief Minister of Haryana, thereby heralding his third and the most creative phase.
For the first time in modern era, the rural people in general and the farmers, the poor and the backward classes in particular, were made to feel that they were part of the decision-making process.
He became Chief Minister, again in 1987, and worked fiercely for the welfare of the masses, there were good results.
Thus, both his tenures were characterized by intense activity on the development front for the rural sector. If his first tenure was remembered for the reduction of interest on loans taken by farmers and labourers, the brick-lining of the water channels, implementation of matching grants for development of villages, the second is remembered for even more momentous decisions. In a historical decision, he freed the farmers, the backward classes and the small shopkeepers of the debt trap when their loans were waived. He also had an eye for the weakest in the society. That is why he offered a Rupee a day' scheme for the children of the nomadic tribes to draw them to schools and education. He also implemented a scheme to give financial assistance of Rs. 300 each to the women belonging to the Scheduled Caste at the time of child birth to enable them to have nutritious diet.
As I have mentioned already, I knew at a very young age that my father was not an ordinary person, and certainly not an ordinary father. I saw his fatherly image grow till it had under its wings the whole of the country. His paternal concern for all was well known, but it was his second term as Chief Minister which saw him evolve as 'Tau' of the society.

INDIVIDUAL’S DIGNITY
When he proclaimed old--age pension in Haryana, he acknowledged that the old and the infirm were entitled to dignity in their twilight years, and, that the state was duty bound to take care of those who had been laid low by age. In his concern for the old, he did not forget the young, who, though educated, were forced to ask for maintenance allowance from their families because of unemployment. He offered them token allowance and the privilege to travel free in public transport when going for an interview. History shows that there was a race among the rest of the states in the country to launch such welfare schemes. But Ch. Devi Lal was the first to have the sensitivity and the courage to admit that if there was no provision in the government budgets for such schemes, such a provision had to be made. This earned him the affectionate and respectful title of 'Tau' . It is a title that has come straight out of the hearts of the people across the length and breadth of the country, and is a result of the spontaneous expression of thanks.
He loved to be addressed as 'Tau', for he knew that this single household word had ensured a place for him in history. This perhaps explains his refusal to be the Prime Minister, though he was elected unanimously the Leader of the United Front Parliamentary Party. He said at that time that the people of the country address him as 'Tau', and he on his part preferred that role much more!
It is another matter that he became Deputy Prime Minister twice after that episode in 1989, but his concern for the farmers, the poor and the backward classes remained paramount always. In 1979, he had staked his office of Chief Minister by deciding to attend a farmers' rally being held to felicitate late Ch. Charan Singh; in 1990 he was again to stake everything for espousing the cause of the farmers while being in the VP.Singh government.
The cause or the issue was always greater than the office for him, and all his life he remained committed to the cause of the welfare of the farming community, and the issue of removal of poverty. For this he was ever willing to walk an extra mile, to make any sacrifice. But he was also aware that the means for achieving the goals have to be just, democratic and constitutional. This alone explains the evolution of his famous quote 'Lok Raj, Lok laj se chalta hai' A lofty goal can only be achieved through noble means, this is amply proved by his 72 years of work in public life.

Widely acclaimed as Vikas Purush of Haryana, Chaudhary Om Parkash Chautala comes of a famous political family of the country, having its roots in the village Chautala (Haryana) bordering the state of Rajasthan in India. He is the eldest son of Late Ch. Devi Lal, a veteran freedom fighter and affectionately known as Tau to one and all, whose illustrious political career culminated in his becoming the Deputy Prime Minister of the country in the year 1989.
Ajay Singh Chautala (b. 13 March 1961), son of Shri Om Prakash Chautala, Chief Minister, Haryana and grandson of Ch. Devi Lal, did his B.A. from Kurukshetra University, M.A. (Public Administration) and LL.B. from Rajasthan University. He joined active politics in 1980s, became MLA from Rajasthan twice: first from Data Ram Garh (1989) and then from Nauhar (1993). He becameMember of Parliament from Bhiwani Constituency. He is currently member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha). He became President of the Youth Wing of Indian National Lok Dal and secretary General of Indian National Lokdal Party.

Chaudhary Devi Lal was one of those first generation political leaders of the country who provided the link between the times of freedom struggle and times since achievement of Independence. With values imbibed during the freedom struggle, he relentlessly toiled for the welfare of the masses and rose to becoming Chief Minister of the State of Haryana and later Deputy Prime Minister of India.
Inspired by the ideals of the veterans of the freedom struggle like Lala Lajpat Rai andJawarharlal Nehru, he abandoned education rather early for fighting as a foot soldier against the British rulers. He was an active participant in Mahatma Gandhi's Civil Disobedience Movement. In the process, he spent more than four years of his early years of life in jail.
He strongly believed, and rightly so, that the peasantry is the backbone of India. Though he was himself the son of a big landlord, he was very keen on giving a fair deal to tenants and the labouring classes, especially the Dalits. He stood for enfranchisement oflands held on tenancy.
Chaudhary Devi Lal was also deeply inspired by the Ideals of Acharya Vinoba Bhave and participated in the Bhoodan Movement.
He stood for modernization of agriculture. He was a strong supporter of induction of: High Yielding Varieties technology, water conservation, energisation of agriculture and, most importantly, remunerative prices for farm produce. It was during his tenure as Deputy Prime Minister with charge of Agriculture portfolio that true beginnings were made for the establishment of the National Policy on Agriculture,
Rural development was close to his heart. As Deputy Prime Minister, he gave a new direction to the Planning process and called for significant enhancement of resource allocations for rural development. He wanted the cooperative movement to be strengthened too. In the true Gandhi an tradition, he urged for development of artisanal employments in the rural areas,
Chaudhary Devi Lal also wanted meaningful investments in education, especially in a manner relevant to employment for the youth. ""While he addressed the concerns of the youth in terms of education and skill development, he worked for the social security of the aged like through provision of Old Age Pensions.
He was one of the architects of the State of Haryana, the creation of which materialized in 1966. The features of the model of administration he believed in were balanced regional development, welfare and decentralization.
In politics, he was a true secularist. He abhorred involvement of business houses in politics and advised his followers to keep the business of politics outside the politics of business. He stood for probity and standards in public life,
He wanted the emergence of a strong 'third force' in politics and made his own contribution to this by the sheer dint of his personality. The manner in which he elegantly declined the position of the Prime Minister of the country in favour of Hon'ble Shri VP. Singh when he was unanimously elected as Leader of the Parliamentary Party in 1989 will go down in the annals ofIndia's political history as a rare and supreme example of selflessness.
Chaudhary Devi Lal was truly a national leader, even as his parliamentary career would reflect. When has was a member of Seventh Lok Sabha from 1980-1982, he represented Sonepat in Haryana. Second time over, when he was memeber of the Ninth Lok Sabha from 1989-1991, he had been returned from the State of Rajasthan, from the Sikar Parliamentary constituency.
Chaudhary Devi Lal, like Mahatma Gandhi himself, had the rare capability of totally identifying himself with the masses. The dress he wore, the food he ate, the language he spoke and the interests he unfailingly fought for were those of the masses.
This work gives rare insights into the making, thoughts and deeds of one of the greatest sons of India.

Krishan Kant Former Vice-President of India
I am happy to know that a book edited by Shri Ajay Singh Chautala, M.P. titled 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out, commemorating his multifaceted contributions to the country. Chaudhary Devi Lal was one of the prominent leaders during India's struggle for Independence as well as in the post-independence politics. He was truly a mass leader, who enjoyed the unreserved support and affection of the people, especially the farmers, whom he served with boundless zeal and commitment.

Former Prime Minister of India

I am happy to learn that a book under the title 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out. Chaudhary Sahib was not only tall in physical personality, but also in fighting for the cause of poor, oppressed and the depressed.
Chaudhary Devi Lal's philosophy had two main objectives. One was to attain the Independence for his country, which he loved very intensely. He contributed his mite to this by participating in the freedom struggle. The second objective was to struggle without rest or waiting for the emancipation of poor, downtrodden and farmers. He firmly believed that to remove poverty and to make poor to live a dignified life, Agriculture has to be inevitably developed. Though born in a family of Landlords, he campaigned for the cause of tenants and labourers. He firmly believed that, without improving Agriculture and the poor farmers who are engaged in it, it is just impossible to achieve over-all economic development and to remove poverty.
His whole life was a continuous struggle, without compromising, for improving the conditions of farmers and agriculture. In this aspect, Chaudhary Devi Lal's is a shining model inspiring all of us forever.
He had occupied the high post of Deputy Prime Minister of India declining to become the Prime Minister. During his tenure as Chief Minister of Haryana, the State witnessed unparalleled development in rural, social and industrial infrastructural sectors.
I am confident that the book that is being brought out will continue to inspire the future generations in regard to his love for the country, farmers and agriculture.
I wish the Chief Editor of this book, Shri Ajay Singh Chautala, Member of Parliament, all success in his efforts to make the book a memorable one.




Chandra Shekhar Former Prime Minister of India
I am happy to know that a book on 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out on the former Deputy Prime Minister of India. Ch. Devi Lal, a veteran Freedom Fighter, a man of masses and champion of Kisans has left an indelible mark on the history of our country. He was one of the titans produced by Freedom Movement. In the initial years of Independence, he fought many battles. At the time of re-organisation of States he raised his voice for a separate State of Haryana and launched massive movement against the Chief Ministers of Punjab, Shri Pratap Singh Kairon and Shri Bhim Sen Sachar and his role in the formation of present State of Haryana is significant. Chaudhary Devi Lal was one of the architects of Haryana for making it a front ranking state of the Country. He was a leader of national stature, who had undergone many ups and downs in his political career. Like a true villager, he spoke what he thought but his sincerity and conviction in pursuing his cherished goal of upliftment of village community cannot be doubted. He sought to give primacy to agriculture in India's socio-economic life. He championed the cause of rural poor and peasants at every stage.
His contribution to nation-building particularly at the grass root level and as Deputy Prime Minister in my Ministry can not be over emphasized. He played an important crucial role in determining the direction of agricultural development and rural uplift.
As Haryana Chief Minister, he took several measures for Agricultural growth as also for the welfare of rural community, such as Old Age Pension Scheme for which he is popularly known as Tau and respected.
I was closely associated with him since the days of Emergency. As Chief Minister of State of Haryana his role to promote and to bring recognition to the village life, the craftsmen and the farmers will always be remembered.
As Deputy Prime Minister in my Cabinet he took many measures for agricultural development.
It is hoped that the younger generation would take inspiration from his ideals to which he stood firm and worked for uplift of rural community despite differences with the concept of urban elite.





Parkash Singh Badal Former Chief Minister, Punjab
It gives me immense pleasure to know that a book on 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out on Ch. Devi Lal, former Deputy Prime Minister of India and a multi-dimensional personality. Jan Nayak Chaudhary Devi Lal was a legendary, towering figure, a tireless crusader and the massiah of common people fondly remembered as 'Tau'. During his long social and political career, he had always adhered to the values of secularism and humanism and championed the cause of the weak. He lived a principled life and kept the people's interest uppermost in mind than self. He raised his irrepressible voice against excesses on the 'have nots' and launched various revolutionary schemes which are still benefiting lakhs of people. The laudable contribution of Chaudhry Sahib during the dark days of emergency for restoring democratic rights to the people and freedom of the Press will be ever remembered.
Ch. Devi Lal was indeed a man of the masses. The effort of bringing out book on life and works of Chaudhary Sahib is indeed laudable and I wish it all success.

It's quite in place that we recall that great 'Tau' of Indianpolity who stayed as a leading light in the country's political firmament for over four decades. Chaudhry Devi Lal - the very name evokes reminiscences of a blunt, plain spoken, towering, even domineering personality. The aura of his out-reaching honesty and incorrigible ingenuity would, in fact, be lost on no one who ever came across him. He spurned office and shunned authority for his austere and egalitarian moorings. Even as Jat peasantry was his main forte, the great Chaudhry did not dwell in caste or communal moulds. I only wish the genre of politicians today to imbibe and emulate such views and values.



Naveen Patnaik Chief Minister, Orissa
It gives me immense pleasure to learn that a book on the veteran leader Chaudhary Devi Lal entitled as 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is going to be published shortly.
Chaudhary Devi Lal was a leader of the masses. He had devoted his entire life for the development of rural India.

I pay my respectful homage to this great personality of our country and wish the publication all success.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE
Ch. Devi Lal's life and work were devoted to the service of peasants, the poor and the under-privileged. He gave all he had to them and did not expect anything in return. He emerged from the backwaters of Haryana, born in a traditional family, broke all traditions, set new standards in public life, gave a new identity to rural masses and a new direction to the country's policy makers. He was a mature politician, a popular leader, an efficient administrator and a good human being. Those who did not come in contact with him and the future generations need to be told that a man like him did live in flesh and blood. This is a fascinating story.
And who are the persons to tell this story? Who else but those who have known him from close quarters, who have watched his life being shaped and influenced by the environment he lived in and have seen him working in his own typical style to leave a mark on the minds of the masses. That the first piece should have come from his son, Haryana Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala, is only natural. Ch. Om Prakash was very dear to him and was groomed by him to take to his ways and style. Nobody else could have known Ch. Devi Lal as intimately as he did, both in personal and public life. That the second chapter should have been written by me, Ch. Devi Lal's grandson, is also no surprise as I had also followed his later years' work keenly and closely. It is said that the generation gap disappears between family elders and their grandchildren and that they interact more freely and frankly than is possible between two consecutive generations.
What follows is the narration of a story in different parts by educationists and agricultural experts who have studied Ch. Devi Lal's life, work and philosophy as keen students of the politics and public life in the region. Some of them like Dr. S. S.Johl, Ch. Sultan Singh, Dr. K. L.Johar, Sh. A. L. Chaudhary, Dr. Harswarup Singh and Dr. P. S. Lamba had come in personal contact with him in working life. Others like Prof. K. C. Yadav, Prof. Hoshiar Singh, Prof. H. L. Verma, Sh. D. K. Kasnia, Dr. Hawa Singh, Dr. Rajpal Singh, Prof. S. D. Chambola, Prof. C. P. Malik and Dr. P. K. Vasudeva have made a scholarly study of his life and times to relate his story to that of the times. Some others like Prof. Sher Singh, Ch. Abhay Singh Chautala, Sh. S. N. Malik, Sh. S. P. Goel, Sh. Ashok Gupta, Monalisa Studio, Hisar and Sh. R. K. Khullar also deserve appreciations for their contribution and support in the preparation of this book.
There is a large variety of subjects-his role in freedom struggle, peasants' and tenants' movements, direction to agriculture policy, contribution towards uplift of the poor and the backward, creation of Haryana state, view of new fields like biotechnology and WTO, passion for nation-building and compassion for the non-elite sections of society. Some events in his life, some traits of his personality and some points of his philosophy may have been repeated but it is only to emphasise them. Also, when different persons are looking at him, they have different interpretations for them.
That such a book should have come so late, after his departure from the scene, is surprising. He would not know what others thought about him but, then, he was so different. He did not react to what others said about him. He went about working for causes dear to him unmindful of how others would take it. The fact is that his life, work and philosophy were over-looked by the intellectuals and the elitist, vocal sections of the society whose comments and opinions on public figures and public issues would make all the difference to resolve and determination of a person to carry on his mission or give up on the way. Not that it would have made a big difference to Ch. Devi Lal who had a one track mind when it came to serving the people. It is only proper that some of the intellectuals have thought of making a serious study about the man and his achievements and gave me the privilege of editing their thoughtful articles and presenting them in a book form. It would be only a part of what was due to Ch. Devi Lal. Perhaps it will mark the beginning of a series of books on him-there can be an independent book on each of his major activities and the ideas behind it.
Different chapters in this book narrate some of his life story and discuss his thinking on various subjects as well as translation of his ideas into practical campaigns and crusades on ground. Whether he felt the need to agitate against the British rulers compelling them to free Indian nation from the shackles of slavery or the need to campaign against their Indian successors for getting a better deal for the oppressed and deprived sections of society, he exerted to the maximum of his strength and resources to achieve his objective. Given his physical and mental strength and the mood of the youth in his early life, he could have become a revolutionary like Sardar Bhagat Singh and his comrades whom he adored. But he opted for Mahatma Gandhi's non-violent ways of agitation. He stuck to them till the last.
As the various chapters of this book unfold different aspects of his multi-facet, multi-dimension personality, the word compassion is repeated by more than one contributors, it is natural because this was the very basic quality, which nobody could have missed noticing in his life and work. He cared for human values, had a consideration for the suffering and woes of the common man. He was sensitive to all that he observed around him and wanted to do something for all, something that would answer their questions and solve their problems. What is more, he loved them all and had a large extended family. Be it his family, his clan, his followers, his countrymen, friends and foes alike, he was keen to serve them all without discrimination and to make this place better to live for not anyone section but for all sections of society. He forgave those clever politicians who considered him a novice and tried to take advantage of his simplicity and smooth sophistication which goes with the politics of the day. He did not mind the superiority complex of the bureaucrats and intellectual elite who he impressed ultimately with his sincerity of purpose and simple solutions to complex problems. He was unmindful even of the smart guys in the media who sometimes made fun of his rustic ways. In fact, he had the best of relations with the newspapermen all his life, whether he was in power or in opposition. Even while in opposition, he was respectful of the media. He could not throw lavish parties at his press conferences but made it up by bringing melons from village in his own car for his press friends. He respected the talent and experience of senior officials but would not let them take him for a ride. He was very considerate to his juniors and small employees too. Those who worked for him in any capacity enjoyed the assignment. In fact, they loved and respected the grand old man. This much for his human relations, all because he loved all human beings! A lot more can be said in this strain. It can be an unending story about the legend that Ch Devi Lal came to be for the people. This book is the beginning of that story.
To compile this book was not an easy task as it involved too much of academic work and commitment of time. For a person like me having a lot of other public engagements sparing time was perhaps the most difficult thing. But inner motivation and encouragement from my family could help to achieve this goal. I would like to place on record my appreciations for all the contributors of the papers and others who remained associated in the preparation of the book. All my well wishers and friends also deserve my special thanks for their cooperation and encouragement in this endeavour.

REMINISCENCES OF A SON
Om Prakash Chautala
How does one remember the life and work of a man, who, as father, taught you the rudiments of life, but never belonged to you fully since he was part of a larger world, also responsible for the well being of all others around him. Nevertheless, I have had the privilege of having an intimate peep into the character and personality of my father Ch. Devi Lal, both as a son as well as one of his most devoted followers in public life. If he taught me how to conduct myself in the family as a child, he also taught me to rise above narrow personal and sectional interests and develop a balanced and humanitarian overview of life.
I must confess that when I first became conscious of the world around me, I was a little perplexed that my father did not lead the normal life like others. There would be moments when I wished my father entirely to myself, like all other children. And yet, my mother's prompting and some deep instinct instructed my very impressionable and young mind that my father was no ordinary human being, and that if he was devoting less attention to me and others in the family, it was because he had to accomplish some other more important tasks. Soon I was to learn that though I was his eldest son, his affection was for a large number of children and people. Rarely did I feel the pangs of jealousy. On the contrary, I always felt elated at the realization that everyone vied for the attention of my father! Those were by all means proud and happy moments of my childhood.
The life and work of Ch. Devi Lal can easily be divided and analysed in three phases, each one more significant and momentous than the other. The first phase, based on the memories and narrations of others, deals with the period before the country's independence. The second phase of his life concerns a period of 30 years beginning with India's independence, and deals with his uninterrupted and uncompromising struggle for securing justice for the people and the region that is now Haryana. The third phase begins with 1977 when he first adorned the office of the Chief Minister of Haryana, a period of governance which was genuinely devoted to creating a modern welfare state, a model for other states.

CALL OF THE MAHATMA
Commitment and dedication to his chosen cause was a hallmark of his character right from his childhood. It was this dedication which made him drop out of the school so that he could respond to the call of Mahatma Gandhi and work as a humble soldier in the freedom struggle. He was deeply influenced by the likes of Lala Lajpat Rai, Martyr Bhagat Singh and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. These leaders, specially their philosophies of life influenced Ch. Devi Lal, and taught him to be ever willing to make any sacrifice when the occasion demanded. They also reinforced his inherent belief in truthfulness, commitment to noble causes and strengthened and intensified his empathy for the poor and the down-trodden.
By the time India attained independence, Ch. Devi Lal had already made his mark as a fearless leader, who could swim against the current if it brought justice to the poor. In 1946, he led the movement for the ownership rights of the tenants, and even in the face of opposition from his own family, he succeeded in bestowing ownership rights to the tenants. Life started looking up slowly but inevitably for the small farmers and the landless.
The second phase of his life marks a period of intense struggle, when under-privileged human beings would have felt intimidated by the disillusionment, frustration and exasperation at not being able to undo a wrong. And yet, unmindful of the setbacks and frequent betrayals by his friends and followers, he went ahead, making the poor, the backward and the farmers aware of their rights and just expectations from the state. This period is indebted to him because his efforts resulted in making the republican spirit of the Indian Constitution an integral part of our life.
This period also marks the creation of the state of Haryana. In an era when the presence of the Congress at the Centre and in the states made it impossible for the Congressmen to express dissent even on matters of high moral principles, Ch. Devi Lal showed exceptional courage in bringing out repeatedly facts and figures both in the Punjab Assembly and outside, to expose the prejudices and blatant injustice against those Hindi-speaking regions of Punjab which now constitute Haryana. It was Ch. Devi Lal's continuous crusade against injustice perpetrated by the then rulers of Punjab that finally resulted in the creation of a state where socio-economic aspirations of the Haryanavis could be realized.

MIDAS TOUCH
This was also a period when I came out of the confines of the home and became an integrated member of his large, extended family. It was then that I began my real education not only in the field of politics, but also in the affairs of humanity, where compassion and empathy were the primary lessons. His organizational skills were unmatched, and his man-management excellent. But what made him stand much above the rest of the leaders was his ability to make the lowly and the weak to aspire boldly for a better and a brighter future. He possessed the midas touch, and all those who came in contact with him went back with the realisation that they carried socio-political responsibility on their shoulders. Their weak shoulders became broad and stout the moment they exchanged a few words and shared their 'hooka' with Ch. Devi Lal.
This period is also memorable as the Prime Minister of the country made a determined attempt to trample democratic principles of the country, and the uncom promising response of the people to such fascist and dictatorial efforts. Not surprisingly, he was again in the forefront of this battle. This period is also significant since the farmers of the state had to wage persistent crusades for claiming their dues. The mantle of leadership for such movements was obviously to fall upon Ch. Devi Lal.

CREATIVE PHASE
The unequivocal verdict of the people of the country in general, and Haryana in particular, was delivered in the general elections to the Lok Sabha in 1977, and the democratic principles and sanctity of the constitution was restored. In the summer of the same year, general elections to the State Assembly were held and for the first time Ch. Devi Lal became Chief Minister of Haryana, thereby heralding his third and the most creative phase.
For the first time in modern era, the rural people in general and the farmers, the poor and the backward classes in particular, were made to feel that they were part of the decision-making process.
He became Chief Minister, again in 1987, and worked fiercely for the welfare of the masses, there were good results.
Thus, both his tenures were characterized by intense activity on the development front for the rural sector. If his first tenure was remembered for the reduction of interest on loans taken by farmers and labourers, the brick-lining of the water channels, implementation of matching grants for development of villages, the second is remembered for even more momentous decisions. In a historical decision, he freed the farmers, the backward classes and the small shopkeepers of the debt trap when their loans were waived. He also had an eye for the weakest in the society. That is why he offered a Rupee a day' scheme for the children of the nomadic tribes to draw them to schools and education. He also implemented a scheme to give financial assistance of Rs. 300 each to the women belonging to the Scheduled Caste at the time of child birth to enable them to have nutritious diet.
As I have mentioned already, I knew at a very young age that my father was not an ordinary person, and certainly not an ordinary father. I saw his fatherly image grow till it had under its wings the whole of the country. His paternal concern for all was well known, but it was his second term as Chief Minister which saw him evolve as 'Tau' of the society.

INDIVIDUAL’S DIGNITY
When he proclaimed old--age pension in Haryana, he acknowledged that the old and the infirm were entitled to dignity in their twilight years, and, that the state was duty bound to take care of those who had been laid low by age. In his concern for the old, he did not forget the young, who, though educated, were forced to ask for maintenance allowance from their families because of unemployment. He offered them token allowance and the privilege to travel free in public transport when going for an interview. History shows that there was a race among the rest of the states in the country to launch such welfare schemes. But Ch. Devi Lal was the first to have the sensitivity and the courage to admit that if there was no provision in the government budgets for such schemes, such a provision had to be made. This earned him the affectionate and respectful title of 'Tau' . It is a title that has come straight out of the hearts of the people across the length and breadth of the country, and is a result of the spontaneous expression of thanks.
He loved to be addressed as 'Tau', for he knew that this single household word had ensured a place for him in history. This perhaps explains his refusal to be the Prime Minister, though he was elected unanimously the Leader of the United Front Parliamentary Party. He said at that time that the people of the country address him as 'Tau', and he on his part preferred that role much more!
It is another matter that he became Deputy Prime Minister twice after that episode in 1989, but his concern for the farmers, the poor and the backward classes remained paramount always. In 1979, he had staked his office of Chief Minister by deciding to attend a farmers' rally being held to felicitate late Ch. Charan Singh; in 1990 he was again to stake everything for espousing the cause of the farmers while being in the VP.Singh government.
The cause or the issue was always greater than the office for him, and all his life he remained committed to the cause of the welfare of the farming community, and the issue of removal of poverty. For this he was ever willing to walk an extra mile, to make any sacrifice. But he was also aware that the means for achieving the goals have to be just, democratic and constitutional. This alone explains the evolution of his famous quote 'Lok Raj, Lok laj se chalta hai' A lofty goal can only be achieved through noble means, this is amply proved by his 72 years of work in public life.

Widely acclaimed as Vikas Purush of Haryana, Chaudhary Om Parkash Chautala comes of a famous political family of the country, having its roots in the village Chautala (Haryana) bordering the state of Rajasthan in India. He is the eldest son of Late Ch. Devi Lal, a veteran freedom fighter and affectionately known as Tau to one and all, whose illustrious political career culminated in his becoming the Deputy Prime Minister of the country in the year 1989.
Ajay Singh Chautala (b. 13 March 1961), son of Shri Om Prakash Chautala, Chief Minister, Haryana and grandson of Ch. Devi Lal, did his B.A. from Kurukshetra University, M.A. (Public Administration) and LL.B. from Rajasthan University. He joined active politics in 1980s, became MLA from Rajasthan twice: first from Data Ram Garh (1989) and then from Nauhar (1993). He becameMember of Parliament from Bhiwani Constituency. He is currently member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha). He became President of the Youth Wing of Indian National Lok Dal and secretary General of Indian National Lokdal Party.

Chaudhary Devi Lal was one of those first generation political leaders of the country who provided the link between the times of freedom struggle and times since achievement of Independence. With values imbibed during the freedom struggle, he relentlessly toiled for the welfare of the masses and rose to becoming Chief Minister of the State of Haryana and later Deputy Prime Minister of India.
Inspired by the ideals of the veterans of the freedom struggle like Lala Lajpat Rai andJawarharlal Nehru, he abandoned education rather early for fighting as a foot soldier against the British rulers. He was an active participant in Mahatma Gandhi's Civil Disobedience Movement. In the process, he spent more than four years of his early years of life in jail.
He strongly believed, and rightly so, that the peasantry is the backbone of India. Though he was himself the son of a big landlord, he was very keen on giving a fair deal to tenants and the labouring classes, especially the Dalits. He stood for enfranchisement oflands held on tenancy.
Chaudhary Devi Lal was also deeply inspired by the Ideals of Acharya Vinoba Bhave and participated in the Bhoodan Movement.
He stood for modernization of agriculture. He was a strong supporter of induction of: High Yielding Varieties technology, water conservation, energisation of agriculture and, most importantly, remunerative prices for farm produce. It was during his tenure as Deputy Prime Minister with charge of Agriculture portfolio that true beginnings were made for the establishment of the National Policy on Agriculture,
Rural development was close to his heart. As Deputy Prime Minister, he gave a new direction to the Planning process and called for significant enhancement of resource allocations for rural development. He wanted the cooperative movement to be strengthened too. In the true Gandhi an tradition, he urged for development of artisanal employments in the rural areas,
Chaudhary Devi Lal also wanted meaningful investments in education, especially in a manner relevant to employment for the youth. ""While he addressed the concerns of the youth in terms of education and skill development, he worked for the social security of the aged like through provision of Old Age Pensions.
He was one of the architects of the State of Haryana, the creation of which materialized in 1966. The features of the model of administration he believed in were balanced regional development, welfare and decentralization.
In politics, he was a true secularist. He abhorred involvement of business houses in politics and advised his followers to keep the business of politics outside the politics of business. He stood for probity and standards in public life,
He wanted the emergence of a strong 'third force' in politics and made his own contribution to this by the sheer dint of his personality. The manner in which he elegantly declined the position of the Prime Minister of the country in favour of Hon'ble Shri VP. Singh when he was unanimously elected as Leader of the Parliamentary Party in 1989 will go down in the annals ofIndia's political history as a rare and supreme example of selflessness.
Chaudhary Devi Lal was truly a national leader, even as his parliamentary career would reflect. When has was a member of Seventh Lok Sabha from 1980-1982, he represented Sonepat in Haryana. Second time over, when he was memeber of the Ninth Lok Sabha from 1989-1991, he had been returned from the State of Rajasthan, from the Sikar Parliamentary constituency.
Chaudhary Devi Lal, like Mahatma Gandhi himself, had the rare capability of totally identifying himself with the masses. The dress he wore, the food he ate, the language he spoke and the interests he unfailingly fought for were those of the masses.
This work gives rare insights into the making, thoughts and deeds of one of the greatest sons of India.

Krishan Kant Former Vice-President of India
I am happy to know that a book edited by Shri Ajay Singh Chautala, M.P. titled 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out, commemorating his multifaceted contributions to the country. Chaudhary Devi Lal was one of the prominent leaders during India's struggle for Independence as well as in the post-independence politics. He was truly a mass leader, who enjoyed the unreserved support and affection of the people, especially the farmers, whom he served with boundless zeal and commitment. His strong espousal of farmers' cause positioned him among the frontline leaders of his times.

Former Prime Minister of India

I am happy to learn that a book under the title 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out. Chaudhary Sahib was not only tall in physical personality, but also in fighting for the cause of poor, oppressed and the depressed.
Chaudhary Devi Lal's philosophy had two main objectives. One was to attain the Independence for his country, which he loved very intensely. He contributed his mite to this by participating in the freedom struggle. The second objective was to struggle without rest or waiting for the emancipation of poor, downtrodden and farmers. He firmly believed that to remove poverty and to make poor to live a dignified life, Agriculture has to be inevitably developed. Though born in a family of Landlords, he campaigned for the cause of tenants and labourers. He firmly believed that, without improving Agriculture and the poor farmers who are engaged in it, it is just impossible to achieve over-all economic development and to remove poverty.
His whole life was a continuous struggle, without compromising, for improving the conditions of farmers and agriculture. In this aspect, Chaudhary Devi Lal's is a shining model inspiring all of us forever.
He had occupied the high post of Deputy Prime Minister of India declining to become the Prime Minister. During his tenure as Chief Minister of Haryana, the State witnessed unparalleled development in rural, social and industrial infrastructural sectors.
I am confident that the book that is being brought out will continue to inspire the future generations in regard to his love for the country, farmers and agriculture.
I wish the Chief Editor of this book, Shri Ajay Singh Chautala, Member of Parliament, all success in his efforts to make the book a memorable one.




Chandra Shekhar Former Prime Minister of India
I am happy to know that a book on 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out on the former Deputy Prime Minister of India. Ch. Devi Lal, a veteran Freedom Fighter, a man of masses and champion of Kisans has left an indelible mark on the history of our country. He was one of the titans produced by Freedom Movement. In the initial years of Independence, he fought many battles. At the time of re-organisation of States he raised his voice for a separate State of Haryana and launched massive movement against the Chief Ministers of Punjab, Shri Pratap Singh Kairon and Shri Bhim Sen Sachar and his role in the formation of present State of Haryana is significant. Chaudhary Devi Lal was one of the architects of Haryana for making it a front ranking state of the Country. He was a leader of national stature, who had undergone many ups and downs in his political career. Like a true villager, he spoke what he thought but his sincerity and conviction in pursuing his cherished goal of upliftment of village community cannot be doubted. He sought to give primacy to agriculture in India's socio-economic life. He championed the cause of rural poor and peasants at every stage.
His contribution to nation-building particularly at the grass root level and as Deputy Prime Minister in my Ministry can not be over emphasized. He played an important crucial role in determining the direction of agricultural development and rural uplift.
As Haryana Chief Minister, he took several measures for Agricultural growth as also for the welfare of rural community, such as Old Age Pension Scheme for which he is popularly known as Tau and respected.
I was closely associated with him since the days of Emergency. As Chief Minister of State of Haryana his role to promote and to bring recognition to the village life, the craftsmen and the farmers will always be remembered.
As Deputy Prime Minister in my Cabinet he took many measures for agricultural development.
It is hoped that the younger generation would take inspiration from his ideals to which he stood firm and worked for uplift of rural community despite differences with the concept of urban elite.





Parkash Singh Badal Former Chief Minister, Punjab
It gives me immense pleasure to know that a book on 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out on Ch. Devi Lal, former Deputy Prime Minister of India and a multi-dimensional personality. Jan Nayak Chaudhary Devi Lal was a legendary, towering figure, a tireless crusader and the massiah of common people fondly remembered as 'Tau'. During his long social and political career, he had always adhered to the values of secularism and humanism and championed the cause of the weak. He lived a principled life and kept the people's interest uppermost in mind than self. He raised his irrepressible voice against excesses on the 'have nots' and launched various revolutionary schemes which are still benefiting lakhs of people. The laudable contribution of Chaudhry Sahib during the dark days of emergency for restoring democratic rights to the people and freedom of the Press will be ever remembered.
Ch. Devi Lal was indeed a man of the masses. The effort of bringing out book on life and works of Chaudhary Sahib is indeed laudable and I wish it all success.





Dr. Farooq Abdullah
It's quite in place that we recall that great 'Tau' of Indianpolity who stayed as a leading light in the country's political firmament for over four decades. Chaudhry Devi Lal - the very name evokes reminiscences of a blunt, plain spoken, towering, even domineering personality. The aura of his out-reaching honesty and incorrigible ingenuity would, in fact, be lost on no one who ever came across him. He spurned office and shunned authority for his austere and egalitarian moorings. Even as Jat peasantry was his main forte, the great Chaudhry did not dwell in caste or communal moulds. I only wish the genre of politicians today to imbibe and emulate such views and values.



Naveen Patnaik Chief Minister, Orissa
It gives me immense pleasure to learn that a book on the veteran leader Chaudhary Devi Lal entitled as 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is going to be published shortly.
Chaudhary Devi Lal was a leader of the masses. He had devoted his entire life for the development of rural India. He had all along been espousing the cause of the peasants, the poor and the down-trodden. His concern for the development of agriculture and rural economy is well known. Chaudhary Devi Lal was a great patriot and freedom fighter and a good friend of Biju Babu.
I pay my respectful homage to this great personality of our country and wish the publication all success.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE
Ch. Devi Lal's life and work were devoted to the service of peasants, the poor and the under-privileged. He gave all he had to them and did not expect anything in return. He emerged from the backwaters of Haryana, born in a traditional family, broke all traditions, set new standards in public life, gave a new identity to rural masses and a new direction to the country's policy makers. He was a mature politician, a popular leader, an efficient administrator and a good human being. Those who did not come in contact with him and the future generations need to be told that a man like him did live in flesh and blood. This is a fascinating story.
And who are the persons to tell this story? Who else but those who have known him from close quarters, who have watched his life being shaped and influenced by the environment he lived in and have seen him working in his own typical style to leave a mark on the minds of the masses. That the first piece should have come from his son, Haryana Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala, is only natural. Ch. Om Prakash was very dear to him and was groomed by him to take to his ways and style. Nobody else could have known Ch. Devi Lal as intimately as he did, both in personal and public life. That the second chapter should have been written by me, Ch. Devi Lal's grandson, is also no surprise as I had also followed his later years' work keenly and closely. It is said that the generation gap disappears between family elders and their grandchildren and that they interact more freely and frankly than is possible between two consecutive generations.
What follows is the narration of a story in different parts by educationists and agricultural experts who have studied Ch. Devi Lal's life, work and philosophy as keen students of the politics and public life in the region. Some of them like Dr. S. S.Johl, Ch. Sultan Singh, Dr. K. L.Johar, Sh. A. L. Chaudhary, Dr. Harswarup Singh and Dr. P. S. Lamba had come in personal contact with him in working life. Others like Prof. K. C. Yadav, Prof. Hoshiar Singh, Prof. H. L. Verma, Sh. D. K. Kasnia, Dr. Hawa Singh, Dr. Rajpal Singh, Prof. S. D. Chambola, Prof. C. P. Malik and Dr. P. K. Vasudeva have made a scholarly study of his life and times to relate his story to that of the times. Some others like Prof. Sher Singh, Ch. Abhay Singh Chautala, Sh. S. N. Malik, Sh. S. P. Goel, Sh. Ashok Gupta, Monalisa Studio, Hisar and Sh. R. K. Khullar also deserve appreciations for their contribution and support in the preparation of this book.
There is a large variety of subjects-his role in freedom struggle, peasants' and tenants' movements, direction to agriculture policy, contribution towards uplift of the poor and the backward, creation of Haryana state, view of new fields like biotechnology and WTO, passion for nation-building and compassion for the non-elite sections of society. Some events in his life, some traits of his personality and some points of his philosophy may have been repeated but it is only to emphasise them. Also, when different persons are looking at him, they have different interpretations for them.
That such a book should have come so late, after his departure from the scene, is surprising. He would not know what others thought about him but, then, he was so different. He did not react to what others said about him. He went about working for causes dear to him unmindful of how others would take it. The fact is that his life, work and philosophy were over-looked by the intellectuals and the elitist, vocal sections of the society whose comments and opinions on public figures and public issues would make all the difference to resolve and determination of a person to carry on his mission or give up on the way. Not that it would have made a big difference to Ch. Devi Lal who had a one track mind when it came to serving the people. It is only proper that some of the intellectuals have thought of making a serious study about the man and his achievements and gave me the privilege of editing their thoughtful articles and presenting them in a book form. It would be only a part of what was due to Ch. Devi Lal. Perhaps it will mark the beginning of a series of books on him-there can be an independent book on each of his major activities and the ideas behind it.
Different chapters in this book narrate some of his life story and discuss his thinking on various subjects as well as translation of his ideas into practical campaigns and crusades on ground. Whether he felt the need to agitate against the British rulers compelling them to free Indian nation from the shackles of slavery or the need to campaign against their Indian successors for getting a better deal for the oppressed and deprived sections of society, he exerted to the maximum of his strength and resources to achieve his objective. Given his physical and mental strength and the mood of the youth in his early life, he could have become a revolutionary like Sardar Bhagat Singh and his comrades whom he adored. But he opted for Mahatma Gandhi's non-violent ways of agitation. He stuck to them till the last.
As the various chapters of this book unfold different aspects of his multi-facet, multi-dimension personality, the word compassion is repeated by more than one contributors, it is natural because this was the very basic quality, which nobody could have missed noticing in his life and work. He cared for human values, had a consideration for the suffering and woes of the common man. He was sensitive to all that he observed around him and wanted to do something for all, something that would answer their questions and solve their problems. What is more, he loved them all and had a large extended family. Be it his family, his clan, his followers, his countrymen, friends and foes alike, he was keen to serve them all without discrimination and to make this place better to live for not anyone section but for all sections of society. He forgave those clever politicians who considered him a novice and tried to take advantage of his simplicity and smooth sophistication which goes with the politics of the day. He did not mind the superiority complex of the bureaucrats and intellectual elite who he impressed ultimately with his sincerity of purpose and simple solutions to complex problems. He was unmindful even of the smart guys in the media who sometimes made fun of his rustic ways. In fact, he had the best of relations with the newspapermen all his life, whether he was in power or in opposition. Even while in opposition, he was respectful of the media. He could not throw lavish parties at his press conferences but made it up by bringing melons from village in his own car for his press friends. He respected the talent and experience of senior officials but would not let them take him for a ride. He was very considerate to his juniors and small employees too. Those who worked for him in any capacity enjoyed the assignment. In fact, they loved and respected the grand old man. This much for his human relations, all because he loved all human beings! A lot more can be said in this strain. It can be an unending story about the legend that Ch Devi Lal came to be for the people. This book is the beginning of that story.
To compile this book was not an easy task as it involved too much of academic work and commitment of time. For a person like me having a lot of other public engagements sparing time was perhaps the most difficult thing. But inner motivation and encouragement from my family could help to achieve this goal. I would like to place on record my appreciations for all the contributors of the papers and others who remained associated in the preparation of the book. All my well wishers and friends also deserve my special thanks for their cooperation and encouragement in this endeavour.

REMINISCENCES OF A SON
Om Prakash Chautala
How does one remember the life and work of a man, who, as father, taught you the rudiments of life, but never belonged to you fully since he was part of a larger world, also responsible for the well being of all others around him. Nevertheless, I have had the privilege of having an intimate peep into the character and personality of my father Ch. Devi Lal, both as a son as well as one of his most devoted followers in public life. If he taught me how to conduct myself in the family as a child, he also taught me to rise above narrow personal and sectional interests and develop a balanced and humanitarian overview of life.
I must confess that when I first became conscious of the world around me, I was a little perplexed that my father did not lead the normal life like others. There would be moments when I wished my father entirely to myself, like all other children. And yet, my mother's prompting and some deep instinct instructed my very impressionable and young mind that my father was no ordinary human being, and that if he was devoting less attention to me and others in the family, it was because he had to accomplish some other more important tasks. Soon I was to learn that though I was his eldest son, his affection was for a large number of children and people. Rarely did I feel the pangs of jealousy. On the contrary, I always felt elated at the realization that everyone vied for the attention of my father! Those were by all means proud and happy moments of my childhood.
The life and work of Ch. Devi Lal can easily be divided and analysed in three phases, each one more significant and momentous than the other. The first phase, based on the memories and narrations of others, deals with the period before the country's independence. The second phase of his life concerns a period of 30 years beginning with India's independence, and deals with his uninterrupted and uncompromising struggle for securing justice for the people and the region that is now Haryana. The third phase begins with 1977 when he first adorned the office of the Chief Minister of Haryana, a period of governance which was genuinely devoted to creating a modern welfare state, a model for other states.

CALL OF THE MAHATMA
Commitment and dedication to his chosen cause was a hallmark of his character right from his childhood. It was this dedication which made him drop out of the school so that he could respond to the call of Mahatma Gandhi and work as a humble soldier in the freedom struggle. He was deeply influenced by the likes of Lala Lajpat Rai, Martyr Bhagat Singh and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. These leaders, specially their philosophies of life influenced Ch. Devi Lal, and taught him to be ever willing to make any sacrifice when the occasion demanded. They also reinforced his inherent belief in truthfulness, commitment to noble causes and strengthened and intensified his empathy for the poor and the down-trodden.
By the time India attained independence, Ch. Devi Lal had already made his mark as a fearless leader, who could swim against the current if it brought justice to the poor. In 1946, he led the movement for the ownership rights of the tenants, and even in the face of opposition from his own family, he succeeded in bestowing ownership rights to the tenants. Life started looking up slowly but inevitably for the small farmers and the landless.
The second phase of his life marks a period of intense struggle, when under-privileged human beings would have felt intimidated by the disillusionment, frustration and exasperation at not being able to undo a wrong. And yet, unmindful of the setbacks and frequent betrayals by his friends and followers, he went ahead, making the poor, the backward and the farmers aware of their rights and just expectations from the state. This period is indebted to him because his efforts resulted in making the republican spirit of the Indian Constitution an integral part of our life.
This period also marks the creation of the state of Haryana. In an era when the presence of the Congress at the Centre and in the states made it impossible for the Congressmen to express dissent even on matters of high moral principles, Ch. Devi Lal showed exceptional courage in bringing out repeatedly facts and figures both in the Punjab Assembly and outside, to expose the prejudices and blatant injustice against those Hindi-speaking regions of Punjab which now constitute Haryana. It was Ch. Devi Lal's continuous crusade against injustice perpetrated by the then rulers of Punjab that finally resulted in the creation of a state where socio-economic aspirations of the Haryanavis could be realized.

MIDAS TOUCH
This was also a period when I came out of the confines of the home and became an integrated member of his large, extended family. It was then that I began my real education not only in the field of politics, but also in the affairs of humanity, where compassion and empathy were the primary lessons. His organizational skills were unmatched, and his man-management excellent. But what made him stand much above the rest of the leaders was his ability to make the lowly and the weak to aspire boldly for a better and a brighter future. He possessed the midas touch, and all those who came in contact with him went back with the realisation that they carried socio-political responsibility on their shoulders. Their weak shoulders became broad and stout the moment they exchanged a few words and shared their 'hooka' with Ch. Devi Lal.
This period is also memorable as the Prime Minister of the country made a determined attempt to trample democratic principles of the country, and the uncom promising response of the people to such fascist and dictatorial efforts. Not surprisingly, he was again in the forefront of this battle. This period is also significant since the farmers of the state had to wage persistent crusades for claiming their dues. The mantle of leadership for such movements was obviously to fall upon Ch. Devi Lal.

CREATIVE PHASE
The unequivocal verdict of the people of the country in general, and Haryana in particular, was delivered in the general elections to the Lok Sabha in 1977, and the democratic principles and sanctity of the constitution was restored. In the summer of the same year, general elections to the State Assembly were held and for the first time Ch. Devi Lal became Chief Minister of Haryana, thereby heralding his third and the most creative phase.
For the first time in modern era, the rural people in general and the farmers, the poor and the backward classes in particular, were made to feel that they were part of the decision-making process.
He became Chief Minister, again in 1987, and worked fiercely for the welfare of the masses, there were good results.
Thus, both his tenures were characterized by intense activity on the development front for the rural sector. If his first tenure was remembered for the reduction of interest on loans taken by farmers and labourers, the brick-lining of the water channels, implementation of matching grants for development of villages, the second is remembered for even more momentous decisions. In a historical decision, he freed the farmers, the backward classes and the small shopkeepers of the debt trap when their loans were waived. He also had an eye for the weakest in the society. That is why he offered a Rupee a day' scheme for the children of the nomadic tribes to draw them to schools and education. He also implemented a scheme to give financial assistance of Rs. 300 each to the women belonging to the Scheduled Caste at the time of child birth to enable them to have nutritious diet.
As I have mentioned already, I knew at a very young age that my father was not an ordinary person, and certainly not an ordinary father. I saw his fatherly image grow till it had under its wings the whole of the country. His paternal concern for all was well known, but it was his second term as Chief Minister which saw him evolve as 'Tau' of the society.

INDIVIDUAL’S DIGNITY
When he proclaimed old--age pension in Haryana, he acknowledged that the old and the infirm were entitled to dignity in their twilight years, and, that the state was duty bound to take care of those who had been laid low by age. In his concern for the old, he did not forget the young, who, though educated, were forced to ask for maintenance allowance from their families because of unemployment. He offered them token allowance and the privilege to travel free in public transport when going for an interview. History shows that there was a race among the rest of the states in the country to launch such welfare schemes. But Ch. Devi Lal was the first to have the sensitivity and the courage to admit that if there was no provision in the government budgets for such schemes, such a provision had to be made. This earned him the affectionate and respectful title of 'Tau' . It is a title that has come straight out of the hearts of the people across the length and breadth of the country, and is a result of the spontaneous expression of thanks.
He loved to be addressed as 'Tau', for he knew that this single household word had ensured a place for him in history. This perhaps explains his refusal to be the Prime Minister, though he was elected unanimously the Leader of the United Front Parliamentary Party. He said at that time that the people of the country address him as 'Tau', and he on his part preferred that role much more!
It is another matter that he became Deputy Prime Minister twice after that episode in 1989, but his concern for the farmers, the poor and the backward classes remained paramount always. In 1979, he had staked his office of Chief Minister by deciding to attend a farmers' rally being held to felicitate late Ch. Charan Singh; in 1990 he was again to stake everything for espousing the cause of the farmers while being in the VP.Singh government.
The cause or the issue was always greater than the office for him, and all his life he remained committed to the cause of the welfare of the farming community, and the issue of removal of poverty. For this he was ever willing to walk an extra mile, to make any sacrifice. But he was also aware that the means for achieving the goals have to be just, democratic and constitutional. This alone explains the evolution of his famous quote 'Lok Raj, Lok laj se chalta hai' A lofty goal can only be achieved through noble means, this is amply proved by his 72 years of work in public life.

Widely acclaimed as Vikas Purush of Haryana, Chaudhary Om Parkash Chautala comes of a famous political family of the country, having its roots in the village Chautala (Haryana) bordering the state of Rajasthan in India. He is the eldest son of Late Ch. Devi Lal, a veteran freedom fighter and affectionately known as Tau to one and all, whose illustrious political career culminated in his becoming the Deputy Prime Minister of the country in the year 1989.
Ajay Singh Chautala (b. 13 March 1961), son of Shri Om Prakash Chautala, Chief Minister, Haryana and grandson of Ch. Devi Lal, did his B.A. from Kurukshetra University, M.A. (Public Administration) and LL.B. from Rajasthan University. He joined active politics in 1980s, became MLA from Rajasthan twice: first from Data Ram Garh (1989) and then from Nauhar (1993). He becameMember of Parliament from Bhiwani Constituency. He is currently member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha). He became President of the Youth Wing of Indian National Lok Dal and secretary General of Indian National Lokdal Party.

Chaudhary Devi Lal was one of those first generation political leaders of the country who provided the link between the times of freedom struggle and times since achievement of Independence. With values imbibed during the freedom struggle, he relentlessly toiled for the welfare of the masses and rose to becoming Chief Minister of the State of Haryana and later Deputy Prime Minister of India.
Inspired by the ideals of the veterans of the freedom struggle like Lala Lajpat Rai andJawarharlal Nehru, he abandoned education rather early for fighting as a foot soldier against the British rulers. He was an active participant in Mahatma Gandhi's Civil Disobedience Movement. In the process, he spent more than four years of his early years of life in jail.
He strongly believed, and rightly so, that the peasantry is the backbone of India. Though he was himself the son of a big landlord, he was very keen on giving a fair deal to tenants and the labouring classes, especially the Dalits. He stood for enfranchisement oflands held on tenancy.
Chaudhary Devi Lal was also deeply inspired by the Ideals of Acharya Vinoba Bhave and participated in the Bhoodan Movement.
He stood for modernization of agriculture. He was a strong supporter of induction of: High Yielding Varieties technology, water conservation, energisation of agriculture and, most importantly, remunerative prices for farm produce. It was during his tenure as Deputy Prime Minister with charge of Agriculture portfolio that true beginnings were made for the establishment of the National Policy on Agriculture,
Rural development was close to his heart. As Deputy Prime Minister, he gave a new direction to the Planning process and called for significant enhancement of resource allocations for rural development. He wanted the cooperative movement to be strengthened too. In the true Gandhi an tradition, he urged for development of artisanal employments in the rural areas,
Chaudhary Devi Lal also wanted meaningful investments in education, especially in a manner relevant to employment for the youth. ""While he addressed the concerns of the youth in terms of education and skill development, he worked for the social security of the aged like through provision of Old Age Pensions.
He was one of the architects of the State of Haryana, the creation of which materialized in 1966. The features of the model of administration he believed in were balanced regional development, welfare and decentralization.
In politics, he was a true secularist. He abhorred involvement of business houses in politics and advised his followers to keep the business of politics outside the politics of business. He stood for probity and standards in public life,
He wanted the emergence of a strong 'third force' in politics and made his own contribution to this by the sheer dint of his personality. The manner in which he elegantly declined the position of the Prime Minister of the country in favour of Hon'ble Shri VP. Singh when he was unanimously elected as Leader of the Parliamentary Party in 1989 will go down in the annals ofIndia's political history as a rare and supreme example of selflessness.
Chaudhary Devi Lal was truly a national leader, even as his parliamentary career would reflect. When has was a member of Seventh Lok Sabha from 1980-1982, he represented Sonepat in Haryana. Second time over, when he was memeber of the Ninth Lok Sabha from 1989-1991, he had been returned from the State of Rajasthan, from the Sikar Parliamentary constituency.
Chaudhary Devi Lal, like Mahatma Gandhi himself, had the rare capability of totally identifying himself with the masses. The dress he wore, the food he ate, the language he spoke and the interests he unfailingly fought for were those of the masses.
This work gives rare insights into the making, thoughts and deeds of one of the greatest sons of India.

New Delhi 10th October, 2002 (BHAIRON SINGH SHEKHAWAT)








Krishan Kant Former Vice-President of India
I am happy to know that a book edited by Shri Ajay Singh Chautala, M.P. titled 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out, commemorating his multifaceted contributions to the country. Chaudhary Devi Lal was one of the prominent leaders during India's struggle for Independence as well as in the post-independence politics. He was truly a mass leader, who enjoyed the unreserved support and affection of the people, especially the farmers, whom he served with boundless zeal and commitment. His strong espousal of farmers' cause positioned him among the frontline leaders of his times. In his long public career, Chaudhary Devi Lal served with great distinction, both in the State as the people's Chief Minister and in the Centre as the Deputy Prime Minister. He was universally respected for his deep sense of values, service and character, besides his simple, natural and earthy nature. His services to Haryana and the country are truly unforgettable. This is a welcome opportunity for his large circle of friends and admirers to recount the many-splendoured personality of Chaudhary Devi Lal. I wish the publication all success.



Former Prime Minister of India

I am happy to learn that a book under the title 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out. Chaudhary Sahib was not only tall in physical personality, but also in fighting for the cause of poor, oppressed and the depressed.
Chaudhary Devi Lal's philosophy had two main objectives. One was to attain the Independence for his country, which he loved very intensely. He contributed his mite to this by participating in the freedom struggle. The second objective was to struggle without rest or waiting for the emancipation of poor, downtrodden and farmers. He firmly believed that to remove poverty and to make poor to live a dignified life, Agriculture has to be inevitably developed. Though born in a family of Landlords, he campaigned for the cause of tenants and labourers. He firmly believed that, without improving Agriculture and the poor farmers who are engaged in it, it is just impossible to achieve over-all economic development and to remove poverty.
His whole life was a continuous struggle, without compromising, for improving the conditions of farmers and agriculture. In this aspect, Chaudhary Devi Lal's is a shining model inspiring all of us forever.
He had occupied the high post of Deputy Prime Minister of India declining to become the Prime Minister. During his tenure as Chief Minister of Haryana, the State witnessed unparalleled development in rural, social and industrial infrastructural sectors.
I am confident that the book that is being brought out will continue to inspire the future generations in regard to his love for the country, farmers and agriculture.
I wish the Chief Editor of this book, Shri Ajay Singh Chautala, Member of Parliament, all success in his efforts to make the book a memorable one.




Chandra Shekhar Former Prime Minister of India
I am happy to know that a book on 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out on the former Deputy Prime Minister of India. Ch. Devi Lal, a veteran Freedom Fighter, a man of masses and champion of Kisans has left an indelible mark on the history of our country. He was one of the titans produced by Freedom Movement. In the initial years of Independence, he fought many battles. At the time of re-organisation of States he raised his voice for a separate State of Haryana and launched massive movement against the Chief Ministers of Punjab, Shri Pratap Singh Kairon and Shri Bhim Sen Sachar and his role in the formation of present State of Haryana is significant. Chaudhary Devi Lal was one of the architects of Haryana for making it a front ranking state of the Country. He was a leader of national stature, who had undergone many ups and downs in his political career. Like a true villager, he spoke what he thought but his sincerity and conviction in pursuing his cherished goal of upliftment of village community cannot be doubted. He sought to give primacy to agriculture in India's socio-economic life. He championed the cause of rural poor and peasants at every stage.
His contribution to nation-building particularly at the grass root level and as Deputy Prime Minister in my Ministry can not be over emphasized. He played an important crucial role in determining the direction of agricultural development and rural uplift.
As Haryana Chief Minister, he took several measures for Agricultural growth as also for the welfare of rural community, such as Old Age Pension Scheme for which he is popularly known as Tau and respected.
I was closely associated with him since the days of Emergency. As Chief Minister of State of Haryana his role to promote and to bring recognition to the village life, the craftsmen and the farmers will always be remembered.
As Deputy Prime Minister in my Cabinet he took many measures for agricultural development.
It is hoped that the younger generation would take inspiration from his ideals to which he stood firm and worked for uplift of rural community despite differences with the concept of urban elite.





Parkash Singh Badal Former Chief Minister, Punjab
It gives me immense pleasure to know that a book on 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is being brought out on Ch. Devi Lal, former Deputy Prime Minister of India and a multi-dimensional personality. Jan Nayak Chaudhary Devi Lal was a legendary, towering figure, a tireless crusader and the massiah of common people fondly remembered as 'Tau'. During his long social and political career, he had always adhered to the values of secularism and humanism and championed the cause of the weak. He lived a principled life and kept the people's interest uppermost in mind than self. He raised his irrepressible voice against excesses on the 'have nots' and launched various revolutionary schemes which are still benefiting lakhs of people. The laudable contribution of Chaudhry Sahib during the dark days of emergency for restoring democratic rights to the people and freedom of the Press will be ever remembered.
Ch. Devi Lal was indeed a man of the masses. The effort of bringing out book on life and works of Chaudhary Sahib is indeed laudable and I wish it all success.





Dr. Farooq Abdullah
It's quite in place that we recall that great 'Tau' of Indianpolity who stayed as a leading light in the country's political firmament for over four decades. Chaudhry Devi Lal - the very name evokes reminiscences of a blunt, plain spoken, towering, even domineering personality. The aura of his out-reaching honesty and incorrigible ingenuity would, in fact, be lost on no one who ever came across him. He spurned office and shunned authority for his austere and egalitarian moorings. Even as Jat peasantry was his main forte, the great Chaudhry did not dwell in caste or communal moulds. I only wish the genre of politicians today to imbibe and emulate such views and values.



Naveen Patnaik Chief Minister, Orissa
It gives me immense pleasure to learn that a book on the veteran leader Chaudhary Devi Lal entitled as 'Chaudhary Devi Lal : Life, Work and Philosophy' is going to be published shortly.
Chaudhary Devi Lal was a leader of the masses. He had devoted his entire life for the development of rural India. He had all along been espousing the cause of the peasants, the poor and the down-trodden. His concern for the development of agriculture and rural economy is well known. Chaudhary Devi Lal was a great patriot and freedom fighter and a good friend of Biju Babu.
I pay my respectful homage to this great personality of our country and wish the publication all success.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE
Ch. Devi Lal's life and work were devoted to the service of peasants, the poor and the under-privileged. He gave all he had to them and did not expect anything in return. He emerged from the backwaters of Haryana, born in a traditional family, broke all traditions, set new standards in public life, gave a new identity to rural masses and a new direction to the country's policy makers. He was a mature politician, a popular leader, an efficient administrator and a good human being. Those who did not come in contact with him and the future generations need to be told that a man like him did live in flesh and blood. This is a fascinating story.
And who are the persons to tell this story? Who else but those who have known him from close quarters, who have watched his life being shaped and influenced by the environment he lived in and have seen him working in his own typical style to leave a mark on the minds of the masses. That the first piece should have come from his son, Haryana Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala, is only natural. Ch. Om Prakash was very dear to him and was groomed by him to take to his ways and style. Nobody else could have known Ch. Devi Lal as intimately as he did, both in personal and public life. That the second chapter should have been written by me, Ch. Devi Lal's grandson, is also no surprise as I had also followed his later years' work keenly and closely. It is said that the generation gap disappears between family elders and their grandchildren and that they interact more freely and frankly than is possible between two consecutive generations.
What follows is the narration of a story in different parts by educationists and agricultural experts who have studied Ch. Devi Lal's life, work and philosophy as keen students of the politics and public life in the region. Some of them like Dr. S. S.Johl, Ch. Sultan Singh, Dr. K. L.Johar, Sh. A. L. Chaudhary, Dr. Harswarup Singh and Dr. P. S. Lamba had come in personal contact with him in working life. Others like Prof. K. C. Yadav, Prof. Hoshiar Singh, Prof. H. L. Verma, Sh. D. K. Kasnia, Dr. Hawa Singh, Dr. Rajpal Singh, Prof. S. D. Chambola, Prof. C. P. Malik and Dr. P. K. Vasudeva have made a scholarly study of his life and times to relate his story to that of the times. Some others like Prof. Sher Singh, Ch. Abhay Singh Chautala, Sh. S. N. Malik, Sh. S. P. Goel, Sh. Ashok Gupta, Monalisa Studio, Hisar and Sh. R. K. Khullar also deserve appreciations for their contribution and support in the preparation of this book.
There is a large variety of subjects-his role in freedom struggle, peasants' and tenants' movements, direction to agriculture policy, contribution towards uplift of the poor and the backward, creation of Haryana state, view of new fields like biotechnology and WTO, passion for nation-building and compassion for the non-elite sections of society. Some events in his life, some traits of his personality and some points of his philosophy may have been repeated but it is only to emphasise them. Also, when different persons are looking at him, they have different interpretations for them.
That such a book should have come so late, after his departure from the scene, is surprising. He would not know what others thought about him but, then, he was so different. He did not react to what others said about him. He went about working for causes dear to him unmindful of how others would take it. The fact is that his life, work and philosophy were over-looked by the intellectuals and the elitist, vocal sections of the society whose comments and opinions on public figures and public issues would make all the difference to resolve and determination of a person to carry on his mission or give up on the way. Not that it would have made a big difference to Ch. Devi Lal who had a one track mind when it came to serving the people. It is only proper that some of the intellectuals have thought of making a serious study about the man and his achievements and gave me the privilege of editing their thoughtful articles and presenting them in a book form. It would be only a part of what was due to Ch. Devi Lal. Perhaps it will mark the beginning of a series of books on him-there can be an independent book on each of his major activities and the ideas behind it.
Different chapters in this book narrate some of his life story and discuss his thinking on various subjects as well as translation of his ideas into practical campaigns and crusades on ground. Whether he felt the need to agitate against the British rulers compelling them to free Indian nation from the shackles of slavery or the need to campaign against their Indian successors for getting a better deal for the oppressed and deprived sections of society, he exerted to the maximum of his strength and resources to achieve his objective. Given his physical and mental strength and the mood of the youth in his early life, he could have become a revolutionary like Sardar Bhagat Singh and his comrades whom he adored. But he opted for Mahatma Gandhi's non-violent ways of agitation. He stuck to them till the last.
As the various chapters of this book unfold different aspects of his multi-facet, multi-dimension personality, the word compassion is repeated by more than one contributors, it is natural because this was the very basic quality, which nobody could have missed noticing in his life and work. He cared for human values, had a consideration for the suffering and woes of the common man. He was sensitive to all that he observed around him and wanted to do something for all, something that would answer their questions and solve their problems. What is more, he loved them all and had a large extended family. Be it his family, his clan, his followers, his countrymen, friends and foes alike, he was keen to serve them all without discrimination and to make this place better to live for not anyone section but for all sections of society. He forgave those clever politicians who considered him a novice and tried to take advantage of his simplicity and smooth sophistication which goes with the politics of the day. He did not mind the superiority complex of the bureaucrats and intellectual elite who he impressed ultimately with his sincerity of purpose and simple solutions to complex problems. He was unmindful even of the smart guys in the media who sometimes made fun of his rustic ways. In fact, he had the best of relations with the newspapermen all his life, whether he was in power or in opposition. Even while in opposition, he was respectful of the media. He could not throw lavish parties at his press conferences but made it up by bringing melons from village in his own car for his press friends. He respected the talent and experience of senior officials but would not let them take him for a ride. He was very considerate to his juniors and small employees too. Those who worked for him in any capacity enjoyed the assignment. In fact, they loved and respected the grand old man. This much for his human relations, all because he loved all human beings! A lot more can be said in this strain. It can be an unending story about the legend that Ch Devi Lal came to be for the people. This book is the beginning of that story.
To compile this book was not an easy task as it involved too much of academic work and commitment of time. For a person like me having a lot of other public engagements sparing time was perhaps the most difficult thing. But inner motivation and encouragement from my family could help to achieve this goal. I would like to place on record my appreciations for all the contributors of the papers and others who remained associated in the preparation of the book. All my well wishers and friends also deserve my special thanks for their cooperation and encouragement in this endeavour.

REMINISCENCES OF A SON
Om Prakash Chautala
How does one remember the life and work of a man, who, as father, taught you the rudiments of life, but never belonged to you fully since he was part of a larger world, also responsible for the well being of all others around him. Nevertheless, I have had the privilege of having an intimate peep into the character and personality of my father Ch. Devi Lal, both as a son as well as one of his most devoted followers in public life. If he taught me how to conduct myself in the family as a child, he also taught me to rise above narrow personal and sectional interests and develop a balanced and humanitarian overview of life.
I must confess that when I first became conscious of the world around me, I was a little perplexed that my father did not lead the normal life like others. There would be moments when I wished my father entirely to myself, like all other children. And yet, my mother's prompting and some deep instinct instructed my very impressionable and young mind that my father was no ordinary human being, and that if he was devoting less attention to me and others in the family, it was because he had to accomplish some other more important tasks. Soon I was to learn that though I was his eldest son, his affection was for a large number of children and people. Rarely did I feel the pangs of jealousy. On the contrary, I always felt elated at the realization that everyone vied for the attention of my father! Those were by all means proud and happy moments of my childhood.
The life and work of Ch. Devi Lal can easily be divided and analysed in three phases, each one more significant and momentous than the other. The first phase, based on the memories and narrations of others, deals with the period before the country's independence. The second phase of his life concerns a period of 30 years beginning with India's independence, and deals with his uninterrupted and uncompromising struggle for securing justice for the people and the region that is now Haryana. The third phase begins with 1977 when he first adorned the office of the Chief Minister of Haryana, a period of governance which was genuinely devoted to creating a modern welfare state, a model for other states.

CALL OF THE MAHATMA
Commitment and dedication to his chosen cause was a hallmark of his character right from his childhood. It was this dedication which made him drop out of the school so that he could respond to the call of Mahatma Gandhi and work as a humble soldier in the freedom struggle. He was deeply influenced by the likes of Lala Lajpat Rai, Martyr Bhagat Singh and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. These leaders, specially their philosophies of life influenced Ch. Devi Lal, and taught him to be ever willing to make any sacrifice when the occasion demanded. They also reinforced his inherent belief in truthfulness, commitment to noble causes and strengthened and intensified his empathy for the poor and the down-trodden.
By the time India attained independence, Ch. Devi Lal had already made his mark as a fearless leader, who could swim against the current if it brought justice to the poor. In 1946, he led the movement for the ownership rights of the tenants, and even in the face of opposition from his own family, he succeeded in bestowing ownership rights to the tenants. Life started looking up slowly but inevitably for the small farmers and the landless.
The second phase of his life marks a period of intense struggle, when under-privileged human beings would have felt intimidated by the disillusionment, frustration and exasperation at not being able to undo a wrong. And yet, unmindful of the setbacks and frequent betrayals by his friends and followers, he went ahead, making the poor, the backward and the farmers aware of their rights and just expectations from the state. This period is indebted to him because his efforts resulted in making the republican spirit of the Indian Constitution an integral part of our life.
This period also marks the creation of the state of Haryana. In an era when the presence of the Congress at the Centre and in the states made it impossible for the Congressmen to express dissent even on matters of high moral principles, Ch. Devi Lal showed exceptional courage in bringing out repeatedly facts and figures both in the Punjab Assembly and outside, to expose the prejudices and blatant injustice against those Hindi-speaking regions of Punjab which now constitute Haryana. It was Ch. Devi Lal's continuous crusade against injustice perpetrated by the then rulers of Punjab that finally resulted in the creation of a state where socio-economic aspirations of the Haryanavis could be realized.

MIDAS TOUCH
This was also a period when I came out of the confines of the home and became an integrated member of his large, extended family. It was then that I began my real education not only in the field of politics, but also in the affairs of humanity, where compassion and empathy were the primary lessons. His organizational skills were unmatched, and his man-management excellent. But what made him stand much above the rest of the leaders was his ability to make the lowly and the weak to aspire boldly for a better and a brighter future. He possessed the midas touch, and all those who came in contact with him went back with the realisation that they carried socio-political responsibility on their shoulders. Their weak shoulders became broad and stout the moment they exchanged a few words and shared their 'hooka' with Ch. Devi Lal.
This period is also memorable as the Prime Minister of the country made a determined attempt to trample democratic principles of the country, and the uncom promising response of the people to such fascist and dictatorial efforts. Not surprisingly, he was again in the forefront of this battle. This period is also significant since the farmers of the state had to wage persistent crusades for claiming their dues. The mantle of leadership for such movements was obviously to fall upon Ch. Devi Lal.

CREATIVE PHASE
The unequivocal verdict of the people of the country in general, and Haryana in particular, was delivered in the general elections to the Lok Sabha in 1977, and the democratic principles and sanctity of the constitution was restored. In the summer of the same year, general elections to the State Assembly were held and for the first time Ch. Devi Lal became Chief Minister of Haryana, thereby heralding his third and the most creative phase.
For the first time in modern era, the rural people in general and the farmers, the poor and the backward classes in particular, were made to feel that they were part of the decision-making process.
He became Chief Minister, again in 1987, and worked fiercely for the welfare of the masses, there were good results.
Thus, both his tenures were characterized by intense activity on the development front for the rural sector. If his first tenure was remembered for the reduction of interest on loans taken by farmers and labourers, the brick-lining of the water channels, implementation of matching grants for development of villages, the second is remembered for even more momentous decisions. In a historical decision, he freed the farmers, the backward classes and the small shopkeepers of the debt trap when their loans were waived. He also had an eye for the weakest in the society. That is why he offered a Rupee a day' scheme for the children of the nomadic tribes to draw them to schools and education. He also implemented a scheme to give financial assistance of Rs. 300 each to the women belonging to the Scheduled Caste at the time of child birth to enable them to have nutritious diet.
As I have mentioned already, I knew at a very young age that my father was not an ordinary person, and certainly not an ordinary father. I saw his fatherly image grow till it had under its wings the whole of the country. His paternal concern for all was well known, but it was his second term as Chief Minister which saw him evolve as 'Tau' of the society.

INDIVIDUAL’S DIGNITY
When he proclaimed old--age pension in Haryana, he acknowledged that the old and the infirm were entitled to dignity in their twilight years, and, that the state was duty bound to take care of those who had been laid low by age. In his concern for the old, he did not forget the young, who, though educated, were forced to ask for maintenance allowance from their families because of unemployment. He offered them token allowance and the privilege to travel free in public transport when going for an interview. History shows that there was a race among the rest of the states in the country to launch such welfare schemes. But Ch. Devi Lal was the first to have the sensitivity and the courage to admit that if there was no provision in the government budgets for such schemes, such a provision had to be made. This earned him the affectionate and respectful title of 'Tau' . It is a title that has come straight out of the hearts of the people across the length and breadth of the country, and is a result of the spontaneous expression of thanks.
He loved to be addressed as 'Tau', for he knew that this single household word had ensured a place for him in history. This perhaps explains his refusal to be the Prime Minister, though he was elected unanimously the Leader of the United Front Parliamentary Party. He said at that time that the people of the country address him as 'Tau', and he on his part preferred that role much more!
It is another matter that he became Deputy Prime Minister twice after that episode in 1989, but his concern for the farmers, the poor and the backward classes remained paramount always. In 1979, he had staked his office of Chief Minister by deciding to attend a farmers' rally being held to felicitate late Ch. Charan Singh; in 1990 he was again to stake everything for espousing the cause of the farmers while being in the VP.Singh government.
The cause or the issue was always greater than the office for him, and all his life he remained committed to the cause of the welfare of the farming community, and the issue of removal of poverty. For this he was ever willing to walk an extra mile, to make any sacrifice. But he was also aware that the means for achieving the goals have to be just, democratic and constitutional. This alone explains the evolution of his famous quote 'Lok Raj, Lok laj se chalta hai' A lofty goal can only be achieved through noble means, this is amply proved by his 72 years of work in public life.

Widely acclaimed as Vikas Purush of Haryana, Chaudhary Om Parkash Chautala comes of a famous political family of the country, having its roots in the village Chautala (Haryana) bordering the state of Rajasthan in India. He is the eldest son of Late Ch. Devi Lal, a veteran freedom fighter and affectionately known as Tau to one and all, whose illustrious political career culminated in his becoming the Deputy Prime Minister of the country in the year 1989.

Devi Lal, did his B.A. from Kurukshetra University, M.A. (Public Administration) and LL.B. from Rajasthan University.
