"2016-11-03 12:16:14","Telangana Rashtra Samithi (abbreviated as TRS) is an Indian regional political party based in Telangana State. Founded on 27 April 2001 by K. Chandrashekar Rao, with a single point agenda of creating a separate Telangana state with Hyderabad as its capital.[3] It has been instrumental in carrying forth a sustained agitation for the granting of statehood to Telangana.[4]
In the 2014 Telangana Assembly Election, the party won the majority seats and formed the first Government in Telangana State. K. Chandrashekar Rao became the Chief Minister of Telangana. In the 2014 general election it has won 11 seats making it eighth largest party in Lok Sabha. It also won 3 seats in Rajya Sabha.


K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu about Telangana and formed the TRS in 2001 at Hyderabad.[5] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[6]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Indian National Congress and won 26 state assembly seats and also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[7] The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[8] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA.

"2016-10-06 03:33:46","Telangana Rashtra Samithi (abbreviated as TRS) is an Indian regional political party based in Telangana State. Founded on 27 April 2001 by K. Chandrashekar Rao, with a single point agenda of creating a separate Telangana state with Hyderabad as its capital.[3] It has been instrumental in carrying forth a sustained agitation for the granting of statehood to Telangana.[4]
In the 2014 Telangana Assembly Election, the party won the majority seats and formed the first Government in Telangana State. K. Chandrashekar Rao became the Chief Minister of Telangana. In the 2014 general election it has won 11 seats making it eighth largest party in Lok Sabha. It also won 3 seats in Rajya Sabha.


K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu about Telangana and formed the TRS in 2001 at Hyderabad.[5] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[6]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Indian National Congress and won 26 state assembly seats and also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[7] The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[8] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority. All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5-year term. The by-election was held on 29 May 2008.[9] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.

"2016-09-02 09:47:27","Telangana Rashtra Samithi (abbreviated as TRS) is an Indian regional political party based in Telangana State. Founded on 27 April 2001 by K. Chandrashekar Rao, with a single point agenda of creating a separate Telangana state with Hyderabad as its capital.[3] It has been instrumental in carrying forth a sustained agitation for the granting of statehood to Telangana.[4]
In the 2014 Telangana Assembly Election, the party won the majority seats and formed the first Government in Telangana State. K. Chandrashekar Rao became the Chief Minister of Telangana. In the 2014 general election it has won 11 seats making it eighth largest party in Lok Sabha. It also won 3 seats in Rajya Sabha.


K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu about Telangana and formed the TRS in 2001 at Hyderabad.[5] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[6]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Indian National Congress and won 26 state assembly seats and also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[7] The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[8] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority. All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5-year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[9] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.

The TRS’ campaign had no other stars except KCR who addressed over 300 public meetings, heli-hopping around and often addressing more than 10 meetings in a single day. The TRS not only retained its north Telangana stronghold but also made inroads in south Telangana, a Congress bastion.[9]

"2016-08-01 07:35:28","Telangana Rashtra Samithi (abbreviated as TRS) is an Indian regional political party based in Telangana. Founded on 27 April 2001 by K. Chandrashekar Rao, with a single point agenda of creating a separate Telangana state with Hyderabad as its capital.[3] It has been instrumental in carrying forth a sustained agitation for the granting of statehood to Telangana.[4]
In the Telangana Assembly Election, 2014, the party won the majority seats and formed the first Government in Telangana State. K. Chandrashekar Rao became the Chief Minister of Telangana. In the 2014 general election it has won 11 seats making it eighth largest party in Lok Sabha. It also won 3 seats in Rajya Sabha.


K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu about Telangana and formed the TRS in 2001 at Hyderabad.[5] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[6]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Indian National Congress and won 26 state assembly seats and also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[7] The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[8] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority. All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5-year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[9] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.

The TRS’ campaign had no other stars except KCR who addressed over 300 public meetings, heli-hopping around and often addressing more than 10 meetings in a single day. The TRS not only retained its north Telangana stronghold but also made inroads in south Telangana, a Congress bastion.[9]

"2016-07-19 07:23:56","Telangana Rashtra Samithi (abbreviated as TRS) is an Indian regional political party based in Telangana. Founded on 27 April 2001 with a single point agenda of creating a separate Telangana state with Hyderabad as its capital by K. Chandrashekar Rao.[3] It has been instrumental in carrying forth a sustained agitation for the granting of statehood to Telangana.[4]
In Telangana Assembly Election, 2014 party won the majority seats and formed the first Government in Telangana State and K. Chandrashekar Rao has become the Chief Minister of Telangana. In the 2014 general election it has won 11 seats making it eighth largest party in Lok Sabha. It also has won 3 seats in Rajya Sabha.


K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu about Telangana and formed the TRS in 2001 at Hyderabad.[5] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[6]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Indian National Congress and won 26 state assembly seats and also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[7] The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[8] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority. All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5-year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[9] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.

Telangana Rashtra Samithi (abbreviated as TRS) is an Indian regional political party based in Telangana. Founded on 27 April 2001 with a single point agenda of creating a separate Telangana state with Hyderabad as its capital by K. Chandrashekar Rao.[3] It has been instrumental in carrying forth a sustained agitation for the granting of statehood to Telangana.[4]
In Telangana Assembly Election, 2014 party won the majority seats and formed the first Government in Telangana State and K. Chandrashekar Rao has become the Chief Minister of Telangana. In the 2014 general election it has won 11 seats making it eighth largest party in Lok Sabha. It also has won 3 seats in Rajya Sabha.


Telangana Region as it existed before the Andhra Pradesh State in 1956 K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu about Telangana and formed the TRS in 2001 at Siddipet, India Hyderabad.[5] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[6]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Indian National Congress and won 26 state assembly seats and also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[7] The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[8] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority. All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5-year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[9] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.

Telangana Rashtra Samithi (abbreviated as TRS) is an Indian regional political party based in Telangana. Founded on 27 April 2001 with a single point agenda of creating a separate Telangana state with Hyderabad as its capital by K. Chandrashekar Rao.[3] It has been instrumental in carrying forth a sustained agitation for the granting of statehood to Telangana.[4]
In Telangana Assembly Election, 2014 party won the majority seats and formed the first Government in Telangana State and K. Chandrashekar Rao has become the Chief Minister of Telangana. In the 2014 general election it has won 11 MP seats making it the eighth largest party in Lok Sabha.


Telangana Region as it existed before the Andhra Pradesh State in 1956 K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu about Telangana and formed the TRS in 2001 at Siddipet, India Hyderabad.[5] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[6]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Indian National Congress and won 26 state assembly seats and also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[7] The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[8] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority. All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5-year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[9] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.

Telangana Rashtra Samithi (abbreviated as TRS) is an Indian regional political party based in Telangana. Founded on 27 April 2001 with a single point agenda of creating a separate Telangana state with Hyderabad as its capital by K. Chandrashekar Rao.[3] It has been instrumental in carrying forth a sustained agitation for the granting of statehood to Telangana.[4]
In Telangana Assembly Election, 2014 party won the majority seats and formed the first Government in Telangana State and K. Chandrashekar Rao has become the Chief Minister of Telangana. In the 2014 general election it has won 11 MP seats making it the eighth largest party in Lok Sabha.


Telangana Region as it existed before the Andhra Pradesh State in 1956 K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu about Telangana and formed the TRS in 2001 at Siddipet, India Hyderabad.[5] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[6]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Indian National Congress and won 26 state assembly seats and also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[7] The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[8] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority. All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5-year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[9] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.

Telangana Rashtra Samithi (abbreviated as TRS) is an Indian regional political party based in Telangana. Founded on 27 April 2001 with a single point agenda of creating a separate Telangana state with Hyderabad as its capital by K. Chandrashekar Rao.[3] It has been instrumental in carrying forth a sustained agitation for the granting of statehood to Telangana.[4]
In Telangana Assembly Election, 2014 party won the majority seats and formed the first Government in Telangana State and K. Chandrashekar Rao has become the Chief Minister of Telangana.In 2014 general election it has won 11 MP seats making it the eighth largest party in Lok Sabha.


Telangana Region as it existed before the Andhra Pradesh State in 1956 K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu about Telangana and formed the TRS in 2001 at Siddipet, India Hyderabad.[5] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[6]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Indian National Congress and won 26 state assembly seats and also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[7] The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[8] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.

Telangana Rashtra Samithi(abbreviated as TRS) is an Indian regional political party based in Telangana. Founded on 27 April 2001 with a single point agenda of creating a separate Telangana state with Hyderabad as its capital by K.

Telangana Region as it existed before the Andhra Pradesh State in 1956 K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu about Telangana and formed the TRS in 2001 at Siddipet, India Hyderabad.[5] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[6]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Indian National Congress and won 26 state assembly seats and also won 5 parliament seats at the national level.

Telangana Rashtra Samithi(abbreviated as TRS) is an Indian regional political party based in Telangana.Founded on 27 April 2001 with a single point agenda of creating a separate Telangana state with Hyderabad as its capital by K. Chandrashekar Rao.[3]It has been instrumental in carrying forth a sustained agitation for the granting of statehood to Telangana.[4]
In Telangana Assembly Election, 2014 party won the majority seats and formed the first Government in Telangana State and K. Chandrashekar Rao has become the Chief Minister of Telangana.In 2014 general election it has won 11 MP seats making it the eighth largest party in Lok Sabha.


Telangana Region as it existed before the Andhra Pradesh State in 1994. K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu about Telangana and formed the TRS in 2001 at Siddipet, India Hyderabad.[5] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[6]
In the 2004a assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Indian National Congress and won 26 state assembly seats and also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[7]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[8] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5-year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[9] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.
On January 31, 2009, it was announced that TRS officially joined the ""Grand Alliance"" headed by Telugu Desam Party and including the Third Front and various left parties, in upcoming Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. At the same time, it was announced that the Talli Telangana, led by actress Vijayshanti, had merged into the TRS.[10] However, after the elections in Andhra Pradesh were completed, but before the counting of votes, TRS switched allegiance to the NDA, with Rao proclaiming that his party had been stabbed in the back by Congress after giving them oxygen in the 2004 elections.[11] TRS lost 16 of its 26 seats in the Assembly, falling to fourth place with less than 4% of the statewide Assembly vote; and lost three of its five seats in the Lok Sabha, dropping to 6.14% of the LS vote.
On June 19, 2009, Mr.Rao submitted his resignation to the party General Secretary Sirikonda Madhusudhana Chary and was away from party for a short period of time after personal attacks made against him by dissident TRS leaders in wake of the party's electoral defeat.[12]

The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[7]

At the same time, it was announced that the Talli Telangana, led by actress Vijayshanti, had merged into the TRS.[10] However, after the elections in Andhra Pradesh were completed, but before the counting of votes, TRS switched allegiance to the NDA, with Rao proclaiming that his party had been stabbed in the back by Congress after giving them oxygen in the 2004 elections.[11] TRS lost 16 of its 26 seats in the Assembly, falling to fourth place with less than 4% of the statewide Assembly vote; and lost three of its five seats in the Lok Sabha, dropping to 6.14% of the LS vote.
On June 19, 2009, Mr.Rao submitted his resignation to the party General Secretary Sirikonda Madhusudhana Chary and was away from party for a short period of time after personal attacks made against him by dissident TRS leaders in wake of the party's electoral defeat.[12]

The TRS’ campaign had no other stars except KCR who addressed over 300 public meetings, heli-hopping around and often addressing more than 10 meetings in a single day.

Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is a regional political party in the Southern Indian state of Telangana.[3] which is currently running the government in the newly created state of Telangana, carved out of Andhra Pradesh on 2 June 2014.


Telangana Region as it existed before the Andhra Pradesh State in 1994. K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu about Telangana and formed the TRS in 2001 at Siddipet, India Hyderabad.[4] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[5]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Indian National Congress and won 26 state assembly seats and also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[6]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[7] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[8] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.
On January 31, 2009, it was announced that TRS officially joined the ""Grand Alliance"" headed by Telugu Desam Party and including the Third Front and various left parties, in upcoming Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. At the same time, it was announced that the Talli Telangana, led by actress Vijayshanti, had merged into the TRS.[9] However, after the elections in Andhra Pradesh were completed, but before the counting of votes, TRS switched allegiance to the NDA, with Rao proclaiming that his party had been stabbed in the back by Congress after giving them oxygen in the 2004 elections.[10] TRS lost 16 of its 26 seats in the Assembly, falling to fourth place with less than 4% of the statewide Assembly vote; and lost three of its five seats in the Lok Sabha, dropping to 6.14% of the LS vote.
On June 19, 2009, Mr.Rao submitted his resignation to the party General Secretary Sirikonda Madhusudhana Chary and was away from party for a short period of time after personal attacks made against him by dissident TRS leaders in wake of the party's electoral defeat.[11]

The TRS’ campaign had no other stars except KCR who addressed over 300 public meetings, heli-hopping around and often addressing more than 10 meetings in a single day. The TRS not only retained its north Telangana stronghold but also made inroads in south Telangana, a Congress bastion. Later two mla's from BSP joined TRS increasing its strength to 65. [14]

Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is a regional political party in the Southern Indian state of Telangana.[3] which is currently running the government in the newly created state of Telangana, carved out of Andhra Pradesh on 2 June 2014.


Telangana Region as it existed before the Andhra Pradesh State in 1994. K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu about Telangana and formed the TRS in 2001 at Siddipet, India Hyderabad.[4] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[5]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Indian National Congress and won 26 state assembly seats and also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[6]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[7] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[8] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.
On January 31, 2009, it was announced that TRS officially joined the ""Grand Alliance"" headed by Telugu Desam Party and including the Third Front and various left parties, in upcoming Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. At the same time, it was announced that the Talli Telangana, led by actress Vijayshanti, had merged into the TRS.[9] However, after the elections in Andhra Pradesh were completed, but before the counting of votes, TRS switched allegiance to the NDA, with Rao proclaiming that his party had been stabbed in the back by Congress after giving them oxygen in the 2004 elections.[10] TRS lost 16 of its 26 seats in the Assembly, falling to fourth place with less than 4% of the statewide Assembly vote; and lost three of its five seats in the Lok Sabha, dropping to 6.14% of the LS vote.
On June 19, 2009, Mr.Rao submitted his resignation to the party General Secretary Sirikonda Madhusudhana Chary and was away from party for a short period of time after personal attacks made against him by dissident TRS leaders in wake of the party's electoral defeat.[11]
TRS Party president K Chandrasekhar Rao announced a schedule for membership drive, which begins 3rd Feb 2015, and elections to party committees from the village level. After a spectacular victories in the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections in Telangana, The TRS Party is now focused on strengthening itself in the state.
KCR said the TRS Membership Drive 2015 [12] would continue till February 20. Elections to party committees at different levels would be held during March and April.
TRS party officially started registration process to get membership from 03rd Feb 2015.[13]

Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is a regional political party in the Southern Indian state of Telangana.[3] which is currently running the government in the newly created state of Telangana, carved out of Andhra Pradesh on 2 June 2014.


Telangana Region as it existed before the Andhra Pradesh State in 1994. K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu about Telangana and formed the TRS in 2001 at Siddipet, India Hyderabad.[4] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[5]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Indian National Congress and won 26 state assembly seats and also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[6]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[7] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[8] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.
On January 31, 2009, it was announced that TRS officially joined the ""Grand Alliance"" headed by Telugu Desam Party and including the Third Front and various left parties, in upcoming Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. At the same time, it was announced that the Talli Telangana, led by actress Vijayshanti, had merged into the TRS.[9] However, after the elections in Andhra Pradesh were completed, but before the counting of votes, TRS switched allegiance to the NDA, with Rao proclaiming that his party had been stabbed in the back by Congress after giving them oxygen in the 2004 elections.[10] TRS lost 16 of its 26 seats in the Assembly, falling to fourth place with less than 4% of the statewide Assembly vote; and lost three of its five seats in the Lok Sabha, dropping to 6.14% of the LS vote.
On June 19, 2009, Mr.Rao submitted his resignation to the party General Secretary Sirikonda Madhusudhana Chary and was away from party for a short period of time after personal attacks made against him by dissident TRS leaders in wake of the party's electoral defeat.[11]
TRS Party president K Chandrasekhar Rao announced a schedule for membership drive, which begins 3rd Feb 2015, and elections to party committees from the village level. After a spectacular victories in the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections in Telangana, The TRS Party is now focused on strengthening itself in the state.
KCR said the TRS Membership Drive 2015 [12] would continue till February 20. Elections to party committees at different levels would be held during March and April.
TRS party officially started registration process to get membership from 03rd Feb 2015.[13]
In the 2014 Assembly and National Elections, TRS did not align with NDA or UPA and fought the elections on its own. TRS, which led the campaign for a separate State for more than a decade, emerged victorious by winning 11 of the 17 Lok Sabha seats and 63 of the 119 Assembly seats, and emerged as the party with the largest vote share in Telangana. The TRS’ campaign had no other stars except KCR who addressed over 300 public meetings, heli-hopping around and often addressing more than 10 meetings in a single day. The TRS not only retained its north Telangana stronghold but also made inroads in south Telangana, a Congress bastion. Later two mla's from BSP joined TRS increasing its strength to 65. [14]
Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao, has taken oath as the first Chief Minister of the new state of Telangana on June 2, 2014.

The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[6]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[7] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[8] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.
On January 31, 2009, it was announced that TRS officially joined the ""Grand Alliance"" headed by Telugu Desam Party and including the Third Front and various left parties, in upcoming Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. At the same time, it was announced that the Talli Telangana, led by actress Vijayshanti, had merged into the TRS.[9] However, after the elections in Andhra Pradesh were completed, but before the counting of votes, TRS switched allegiance to the NDA, with Rao proclaiming that his party had been stabbed in the back by Congress after giving them oxygen in the 2004 elections.[10] TRS lost 16 of its 26 seats in the Assembly, falling to fourth place with less than 4% of the statewide Assembly vote; and lost three of its five seats in the Lok Sabha, dropping to 6.14% of the LS vote.
On June 19, 2009, Mr.Rao submitted his resignation to the party General Secretary Sirikonda Madhusudhana Chary and was away from party for a short period of time after personal attacks made against him by dissident TRS leaders in wake of the party's electoral defeat.[11]
TRS Party president K Chandrasekhar Rao announced a schedule for membership drive, which begins 3rd Feb 2015, and elections to party committees from the village level. After a spectacular victories in the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections in Telangana, The TRS Party is now focused on strengthening itself in the state.

TRS party officially started registration process to get membership from 03rd Feb 2015.[13]
In the 2014 Assembly and National Elections, TRS did not align with NDA or UPA and fought the elections on its own. TRS, which led the campaign for a separate State for more than a decade, emerged victorious by winning 11 of the 17 Lok Sabha seats and 63 of the 119 Assembly seats, and emerged as the party with the largest vote share in Telangana. The TRS’ campaign had no other stars except KCR who addressed over 300 public meetings, heli-hopping around and often addressing more than 10 meetings in a single day. The TRS not only retained its north Telangana stronghold but also made inroads in south Telangana, a Congress bastion. Later two mla's from BSP joined TRS increasing its strength to 65. [14]

Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is a regional political party in the Southern Indian state of Telangana.[3] which is currently running the government in the newly created state of Telangana, carved out of Andhra Pradesh on 2 June 2014.


Telangana Region as it existed before the formation of Andhra Pradesh State in 1994. K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu about Telangana and formed the TRS in 2001 at Siddipet, India Hyderabad.[4] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[5]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Indian National Congress and won 26 state assembly seats and also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[6]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[7] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA.

Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is a regional political party in the Southern Indian state of Telangana.[3] which is currently running the government in the newly created state of Telangana, carved out of Andhra Pradesh on 2 June 2014.


xisted before the formation of Andhra Pradesh State in 1956. K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu about Telangana and formed the TRS in 2001 at Siddipet, India Hyderabad.[4] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[5]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Indian National Congress and won 26 state assembly seats and also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[6]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[7] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term.

Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is a regional political party in the Southern Indian state of Telangana.[3] which is currently running the government in the newly created state of Telangana, carved out of Andhra Pradesh on 2 June 2014.


Telangana Region as it existed before the formation of Andhra Pradesh State in 1956. K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu about Telangana and formed the TRS in 2001 at Siddipet, India Hyderabad.[4] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[5]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Indian National Congress and won 26 state assembly seats and also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[6]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[7] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[8] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.

Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is a regional political party in the Southern Indian state of Telangana.[3] which is currently running the government in the newly created state of Telangana, carved out of Andhra Pradesh on 2 June 2014.


Telangana Region as it existed before the formation of Andhra Pradesh State in 1956. K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu about Telangana and formed the TRS in 2001 at Siddipet, India Hyderabad.[4] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[5]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Indian National Congress and won 26 state assembly seats and also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[6]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[7] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[8] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.

Telangana Raakshasa Samithi (TRS) is a regional political party in the Southern Indian state of Telangana.[3] which is currently running the government in the newly created state of Telangana, carved out of Andhra Pradesh on 2 June 2014.


Telangana Region as it existed before the formation of Andhra Pradesh State in 1956. K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Raakshasa Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu about Telangana and formed the TRS in 2001 at Siddipet, India Hyderabad.[4] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[5]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Indian National Congress and won 26 state assembly seats and also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[6]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[7] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[8] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.

Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is a regional political party in the Southern Indian state of Telangana.[3] which is currently running the government in the newly created state of Telangana, carved out of Andhra Pradesh on 2 June 2014.


Telangana Region as it existed before the formation of Andhra Pradesh State in 1956. K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu about Telangana and formed the TRS in 2001 at Siddipet, India Hyderabad.[4] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[5]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Indian National Congress and won 26 state assembly seats and also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[6]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[7] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[8] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.

Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is a regional political party in the Southern Indian state of Telangana.[3] which is currently running the government in the newly created state of Telangana, carved out of Andhra Pradesh on 2 June 2014.


Telangana Region as it existed before the formation of Andhra Pradesh State in 1956. K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu about Telangana and formed the TRS in 2001 at Siddipet, India Hyderabad.[4] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[5]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Indian National Congress and won 26 state assembly seats and also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[6]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[7] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[8] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.

TRS, which led the campaign for a separate State for more than a decade, emerged victorious by winning 11 of the 17 Lok Sabha seats and 63 of the 119 Assembly seats, and emerged as the party with the largest vote share in Telangana. The TRS’ campaign had no other stars except KCR who addressed over 300 public meetings, heli-hopping around and often addressing more than 10 meetings in a single day. The TRS not only retained its north Telangana stronghold but also made inroads in south Telangana, a Congress bastion. Later two mla's from BSP joined TRS increasing its strength to 65. [13]

Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is a regional political party in the Southern Indian state of Telangana.[3] which is currently running the government in the newly created state of Telangana, carved out of Andhra Pradesh on 2 June 2014.


Telangana Region as it existed before the formation of Andhra Pradesh State in 1956. K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu about Telangana and formed the TRS in 2001 at Siddipet, India Hyderabad.[4] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[5]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Indian National Congress and won 26 state assembly seats and also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[6]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[7] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[8] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.
On January 31, 2009, it was announced that TRS officially joined the ""Grand Alliance"" headed by Telugu Desam Party and including the Third Front and various left parties, in upcoming Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. At the same time, it was announced that the Talli Telangana, led by actress Vijayshanti, had merged into the TRS.[9] However, after the elections in Andhra Pradesh were completed, but before the counting of votes, TRS switched allegiance to the NDA, with Rao proclaiming that his party had been stabbed in the back by Congress after giving them oxygen in the 2004 elections.[10] TRS lost 16 of its 26 seats in the Assembly, falling to fourth place with less than 4% of the statewide Assembly vote; and lost three of its five seats in the Lok Sabha, dropping to 6.14% of the LS vote.
On June 19, 2009, Mr.Rao submitted his resignation to the party General Secretary Sirikonda Madhusudhana Chary and was away from party for a short period of time after personal attacks made against him by dissident TRS leaders in wake of the party's electoral defeat.[11]

At the same time, it was announced that the Talli Telangana, led by actress Vijayshanti, had merged into the TRS.[9] However, after the elections in Andhra Pradesh were completed, but before the counting of votes, TRS switched allegiance to the NDA, with Rao proclaiming that his party had been stabbed in the back by Congress after giving them oxygen in the 2004 elections.[10] TRS lost 16 of its 26 seats in the Assembly, falling to fourth place with less than 4% of the statewide Assembly vote; and lost three of its five seats in the Lok Sabha, dropping to 6.14% of the LS vote.
On June 19, 2009, Mr.Rao submitted his resignation to the party General Secretary Sirikonda Madhusudhana Chary and was away from party for a short period of time after personal attacks made against him by dissident TRS leaders in wake of the party's electoral defeat.[11]
In the 2014 Assembly and National Elections, TRS did not align with NDA or UPA and fought the elections on its own. TRS, which led the campaign for a separate State for more than a decade, emerged victorious by winning 11 of the 17 Lok Sabha seats and 63 of the 119 Assembly seats, and emerged as the party with the largest vote share in Telangana. The TRS’ campaign had no other stars except KCR who addressed over 300 public meetings, heli-hopping around and often addressing more than 10 meetings in a single day. The TRS not only retained its north Telangana stronghold but also made inroads in south Telangana, a Congress bastion. Later two mla's from BSP joined TRS increasing its strength to 65. [12]

Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is a regional political party in the Southern Indian state of Telangana.[3] which is currently running the government in the newly created state of Telangana, carved out of Andhra Pradesh on 2 June 2014.


Telangana Region as it existed before the formation of Andhra Pradesh State in 1956. K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu about Telangana and formed the TRS in 2001 at Siddipet, India Hyderabad.[4] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[5]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Congress (I) and won 26 state assembly seats and also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[6]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[7] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[8] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.

When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[7] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[8] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.
On January 31, 2009, it was announced that TRS officially joined the ""Grand Alliance"" headed by Telugu Desam Party and including the Third Front and various left parties, in upcoming Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. At the same time, it was announced that the Talli Telangana, led by actress Vijayshanti, had merged into the TRS.[9] However, after the elections in Andhra Pradesh were completed, but before the counting of votes, TRS switched allegiance to the NDA, with Rao proclaiming that his party had been stabbed in the back by Congress after giving them oxygen in the 2004 elections.[10] TRS lost 16 of its 26 seats in the Assembly, falling to fourth place with less than 4% of the statewide Assembly vote; and lost three of its five seats in the Lok Sabha, dropping to 6.14% of the LS vote.
On June 19, 2009, Mr.Rao submitted his resignation to the party General Secretary Sirikonda Madhusudhana Chary and was away from party for a short period of time after personal attacks made against him by dissident TRS leaders in wake of the party's electoral defeat.[11]
In the 2014 Assembly and National Elections, TRS did not align with NDA or UPA and fought the elections on its own. TRS, which led the campaign for a separate State for more than a decade, emerged victorious by winning 11 of the 17 Lok Sabha seats and 63 of the 119 Assembly seats, and emerged as the party with the largest vote share in Telangana. The TRS’ campaign had no other stars except KCR who addressed over 300 public meetings, heli-hopping around and often addressing more than 10 meetings in a single day. The TRS not only retained its north Telangana stronghold but also made inroads in south Telangana, a Congress bastion. Later two mla's from BSP joined TRS increasing its strength to 65. [12]

On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[5]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[6] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[7] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.
On January 31, 2009, it was announced that TRS officially joined the ""Grand Alliance"" headed by Telugu Desam Party and including the Third Front and various left parties, in upcoming Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. At the same time, it was announced that the Talli Telangana, led by actress Vijayshanti, had merged into the TRS.[8] However, after the elections in Andhra Pradesh were completed, but before the counting of votes, TRS switched allegiance to the NDA, with Rao proclaiming that his party had been stabbed in the back by Congress after giving them oxygen in the 2004 elections.[9] TRS lost 16 of its 26 seats in the Assembly, falling to fourth place with less than 4% of the statewide Assembly vote; and lost three of its five seats in the Lok Sabha, dropping to 6.14% of the LS vote.
On June 19, 2009, Mr.Rao submitted his resignation to the party General Secretary Sirikonda Madhusudhana Chary and was away from party for a short period of time after personal attacks made against him by dissident TRS leaders in wake of the party's electoral defeat.[10]
In the 2014 Assembly and National Elections, TRS did not align with NDA or UPA and fought the elections on its own. TRS, which led the campaign for a separate State for more than a decade, emerged victorious by winning 11 of the 17 Lok Sabha seats and 63 of the 119 Assembly seats, and emerged as the party with the largest vote share in Telangana. The TRS’ campaign had no other stars except KCR who addressed over 300 public meetings, heli-hopping around and often addressing more than 10 meetings in a single day. The TRS not only retained its north Telangana stronghold but also made inroads in south Telangana, a Congress bastion. Later two mla's from BSP joined TRS increasing its strength to 65. [11]

Dear Sir, We should publish an action plan youths employement, as the main reason for the Agigation both in 1969 and recently under your self, was for the lack of transparency in Govt. jobs. So, both the JAC and Students under various associations, participated in the agigation for 13 long years.To, infuse confidence in the minds of younger people, internally, a white paper has to be circulated in the cabinet, and accordingly action plan has to worked out, or released to public. Lastly, even for IV th class employees, service commission test is a must, so the eligible youth should be advised to take a coaching - preferable sponsored by the party itself - TRS. We have participated in 1969 movement, and at that time the education qualifications were made null and void for the Osmania University affiliated colleges.

My class mates are in TRS - one is an MP, and another MLA please.
Thanking you Gunna Ravinder Reddy 9242877460 Bangalore

"2014-06-07 23:01:30","Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is a regional political party in the Southern Indian state of Telangana.[2] which is currently running the government in the newly created state of Telangana, carved out of Andhra Pradesh on 2 June 2014.


Telangana Region as it existed before the formation of Andhra Pradesh State in 1956. K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu and formed the TRS in 2001 at Siddipet, India Hyderabad.[3] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[4]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Congress (I) and won 26 state assembly seats. The party also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[5]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[6] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[7] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.
On January 31, 2009, it was announced that TRS officially joined the ""Grand Alliance"" headed by Telugu Desam Party and including the Third Front and various left parties, in upcoming Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. At the same time, it was announced that the Talli Telangana, led by actress Vijayshanti, had merged into the TRS.[8] However, after the elections in Andhra Pradesh were completed, but before the counting of votes, TRS switched allegiance to the NDA, with Rao proclaiming that his party had been stabbed in the back by Congress after giving them oxygen in the 2004 elections.[9] TRS lost 16 of its 26 seats in the Assembly, falling to fourth place with less than 4% of the statewide Assembly vote; and lost three of its five seats in the Lok Sabha, dropping to 6.14% of the LS vote.
On June 19, 2009, Mr.Rao submitted his resignation to the party General Secretary Sirikonda Madhusudhana Chary and was away from party for a short period of time after personal attacks made against him by dissident TRS leaders in wake of the party's electoral defeat.[10]
In the 2014 Assembly and National Elections, TRS did not align with NDA or UPA and fought the elections on its own. TRS, which led the campaign for a separate State for more than a decade, emerged victorious by winning 11 of the 17 Lok Sabha seats and 63 of the 119 Assembly seats, and emerged as the party with the largest vote share in Telangana. The TRS’ campaign had no other stars except KCR who addressed over 300 public meetings, heli-hopping around and often addressing more than 10 meetings in a single day. The TRS not only retained its north Telangana stronghold but also made inroads in south Telangana, a Congress bastion.[11]

"2014-06-05 09:36:40","Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is a regional political party in the Southern Indian state of Telangana.[2]. Now TRS President is CM for Telangana.


Telangana Region as it existed before the formation of Andhra Pradesh State in 1956. K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu and formed the TRS in 2001 at Siddipet, India Hyderabad.[3] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[citation needed]).
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Congress (I) and won 26 state assembly seats. The party also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[4]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[5] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[6] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.
On January 31, 2009, it was announced that TRS officially joined the ""Grand Alliance"" headed by Telugu Desam Party and including the Third Front and various left parties, in upcoming Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. At the same time, it was announced that the Talli Telangana, led by actress Vijayshanti, had merged into the TRS.[7] However, after the elections in Andhra Pradesh were completed, but before the counting of votes, TRS switched allegiance to the NDA, with Rao proclaiming that his party had been stabbed in the back by Congress after giving them oxygen in the 2004 elections.[8] TRS lost 16 of its 26 seats in the Assembly, falling to fourth place with less than 4% of the statewide Assembly vote; and lost three of its five seats in the Lok Sabha, dropping to 6.14% of the LS vote.
On June 19, 2009, Mr.Rao submitted his resignation to the party General Secretary Sirikonda Madhusudhana Chary and was away from party for a short period of time after personal attacks made against him by dissident TRS leaders in wake of the party's electoral defeat.[9]
In the 2014 Assembly and National Elections, TRS did not align with NDA or UPA and fought the elections on its own.

Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu and formed the TRS in 2001 at Siddipet, India Hyderabad.[2] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[citation needed]).
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Congress (I) and won 26 state assembly seats. The party also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[3]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[4] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[5] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.
On January 31, 2009, it was announced that TRS officially joined the ""Grand Alliance"" headed by Telugu Desam Party and including the Third Front and various left parties, in upcoming Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. At the same time, it was announced that the Talli Telangana, led by actress Vijayshanti, had merged into the TRS.[6] However, after the elections in Andhra Pradesh were completed, but before the counting of votes, TRS switched allegiance to the NDA, with Rao proclaiming that his party had been stabbed in the back by Congress after giving them oxygen in the 2004 elections.[7] TRS lost 16 of its 26 seats in the Assembly, falling to fourth place with less than 4% of the statewide Assembly vote; and lost three of its five seats in the Lok Sabha, dropping to 6.14% of the LS vote.
On June 19, 2009, Mr.Rao submitted his resignation to the party General Secretary Mr.Sirikonda MadhuSudhana Chary and was away from party for a short period of time after personal attacks made against him by dissident TRS leaders in wake of the party's electoral defeat.[8]
In the 2014 Assembly and National Elections, TRS did not align with NDA or UPA and fought the elections on its own. TRS, which led the campaign for a separate State for more than a decade, emerged victorious by winning 11 of the 17 Lok Sabha seats and 63 of the 119 Assembly seats, and emerged as the party with the largest vote share in Telangana. The TRS’ campaign had no other stars except KCR who addressed over 300 public meetings, heli-hopping around and often addressing more than 10 meetings in a single day. The TRS not only retained its north Telangana stronghold but also made inroads in south Telangana, a Congress bastion.[9]

The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[2]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[3] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[4] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.
On January 31, 2009, it was announced that TRS officially joined the ""Grand Alliance"" headed by Telugu Desam Party and including the Third Front and various left parties, in upcoming Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. At the same time, it was announced that the Talli Telangana, led by actress Vijayshanti, had merged into the TRS.[5] However, after the elections in Andhra Pradesh were completed, but before the counting of votes, TRS switched allegiance to the NDA, with Rao proclaiming that his party had been stabbed in the back by Congress after giving them oxygen in the 2004 elections.[6] TRS lost 16 of its 26 seats in the Assembly, falling to fourth place with less than 4% of the statewide Assembly vote; and lost three of its five seats in the Lok Sabha, dropping to 6.14% of the LS vote.
On June 19, 2009, Mr.Rao submitted his resignation to the party General Secretary Mr.Sirikonda MadhuSudhana Chary and was away from party for a short period of time after personal attacks made against him by dissident TRS leaders in wake of the party's electoral defeat.[7]
In the 2014 Assembly and National Elections, TRS did not align with NDA or UPA and fought the elections on its own. TRS, which led the campaign for a separate State for more than a decade, emerged victorious by winning 11 of the 17 Lok Sabha seats and 63 of the 119 Assembly seats, and emerged as the party with the largest vote share in Telangana. The TRS’ campaign had no other stars except KCR who addressed over 300 public meetings, heli-hopping around and often addressing more than 10 meetings in a single day.

Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu and formed the TRS in 2001 at Siddipet, India Hyderabad.[1] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[citation needed]).
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Congress (I) and won 26 state assembly seats. The party also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[2]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[3] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[4] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.
On January 31, 2009, it was announced that TRS officially joined the ""Grand Alliance"" headed by Telugu Desam Party and including the Third Front and various left parties, in upcoming Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. At the same time, it was announced that the Talli Telangana, led by actress Vijayshanti, had merged into the TRS.[5] However, after the elections in Andhra Pradesh were completed, but before the counting of votes, TRS switched allegiance to the NDA, with Rao proclaiming that his party had been stabbed in the back by Congress after giving them oxygen in the 2004 elections.[6] TRS lost 16 of its 26 seats in the Assembly, falling to fourth place with less than 4% of the statewide Assembly vote; and lost three of its five seats in the Lok Sabha, dropping to 6.14% of the LS vote.
On June 19, 2009, Mr.Rao submitted his resignation to the party General Secretary Mr.Sirikonda MadhuSudhana Chary and was away from party for a short period of time after personal attacks made against him by dissident TRS leaders in wake of the party's electoral defeat.[7]

In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Congress (I) and won 26 state assembly seats. The party also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state.

Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu and formed the TRS in 2001 at Hyderabad.[1] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[citation needed]).
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Congress (I) and won 26 state assembly seats. The party also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[2]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[3] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[4] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.
On January 31, 2009, it was announced that TRS officially joined the ""Grand Alliance"" headed by Telugu Desam Party and including the Third Front and various left parties, in upcoming Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. At the same time, it was announced that the Talli Telangana, led by actress Vijayshanti, had merged into the TRS.[5] However, after the elections in Andhra Pradesh were completed, but before the counting of votes, TRS switched allegiance to the NDA, with Rao proclaiming that his party had been stabbed in the back by Congress after giving them oxygen in the 2004 elections.[6] TRS lost 16 of its 26 seats in the Assembly, falling to fourth place with less than 4% of the statewide Assembly vote; and lost three of its five seats in the Lok Sabha, dropping to 6.14% of the LS vote.
On June 19, 2009, Mr.Rao submitted his resignation to the party General Secretary Mr.Sirikonda MadhuSudhana Chary and was away from party for a short period of time after personal attacks made against him by dissident TRS leaders in wake of the party's electoral defeat.[7]

In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Congress (I) and won 26 state assembly seats. The party also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[2]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[3] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[4] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.
On January 31, 2009, it was announced that TRS officially joined the ""Grand Alliance"" headed by Telugu Desam Party and including the Third Front and various left parties, in upcoming Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. At the same time, it was announced that the Talli Telangana, led by actress Vijayshanti, had merged into the TRS.[5] However, after the elections in Andhra Pradesh were completed, but before the counting of votes, TRS switched allegiance to the NDA, with Rao proclaiming that his party had been stabbed in the back by Congress after giving them oxygen in the 2004 elections.[6] TRS lost 16 of its 26 seats in the Assembly, falling to fourth place with less than 4% of the statewide Assembly vote; and lost three of its five seats in the Lok Sabha, dropping to 6.14% of the LS vote.
On June 19, 2009, Mr.Rao submitted his resignation to the party General Secretary Mr.Sirikonda MadhuSudhana Chary and was away from party for a short period of time after personal attacks made against him by dissident TRS leaders in wake of the party's electoral defeat.[7]

Telangana Rashtra Samithi's main aim is to separate Telangana region from Andhra Pradesh and to regain regional autonomy as it existed before the formation of Andhra Pradesh State in 1956. K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu and formed the TRS in 2001 at Hyderabad.[1] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[citation needed]).
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Congress (I) and won 26 state assembly seats. The party also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[2]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[3] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA.

Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu and formed the TRS in 2001 at Hyderabad.[1] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[citation needed]).
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Congress (I) and won 26 state assembly seats. The party also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that, how can a party with an adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[2]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[3] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[4] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.
On January 31, 2009, it was announced that TRS officially joined the ""Grand Alliance"" headed by Telugu Desam Party and including the Third Front and various left parties, in upcoming Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. At the same time, it was announced that the Talli Telangana, led by actress Vijayshanti, had merged into the TRS.[5] However, after the elections in Andhra Pradesh were completed, but before the counting of votes, TRS switched allegiance to the NDA, with Rao proclaiming that his party had been stabbed in the back by Congress after giving them oxygen in the 2004 elections.[6] TRS lost 16 of its 26 seats in the Assembly, falling to fourth place with less than 4% of the statewide Assembly vote; and lost three of its five seats in the Lok Sabha, dropping to 6.14% of the LS vote.
On June 19, 2009, Mr.Rao submitted his resignation to the party General Secretary Mr.Sirikonda MadhuSudhana Chary and was away from party for a short period of time after personal attacks made against him by dissident TRS leaders in wake of the party's electoral defeat.[7]

In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Congress (I) and won 26 state assembly seats. The party also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that,How can a party with a adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months ? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[2]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[3] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[4] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.
On January 31, 2009, it was announced that TRS officially joined the ""Grand Alliance"" headed by Telugu Desam Party and including the Third Front and various left parties, in upcoming Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. At the same time, it was announced that the Talli Telangana, led by actress Vijayshanti, had merged into the TRS.[5] However, after the elections in Andhra Pradesh were completed, but before the counting of votes, TRS switched allegiance to the NDA, with Rao proclaiming that his party had been stabbed in the back by Congress after giving them oxygen in the 2004 elections.[6] TRS lost 16 of its 26 seats in the Assembly, falling to fourth place with less than 4% of the statewide Assembly vote; and lost three of its five seats in the Lok Sabha, dropping to 6.14% of the LS vote.
On June 19, 2009, Mr.Rao submitted his resignation to the party General Secretary Mr.Sirikonda MadhuSudhana Chary and was away from party for a short period of time after personal attacks made against him by dissident TRS leaders in wake of the party's electoral defeat.[7]

The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[citation needed]).
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Congress (I) and won 26 state assembly seats. The party also won 5 parliament seats at the national level.

In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that,How can a party with a adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months ? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members.[2]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[3] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[4] In the by-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.
On January 31, 2009, it was announced that TRS officially joined the ""Grand Alliance"" headed by Telugu Desam Party and including the Third Front and various left parties, in upcoming Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. At the same time, it was announced that the Talli Telangana, led by actress Vijayshanti, had merged into the TRS.[5] However, after the elections in Andhra Pradesh were completed, but before the counting of votes, TRS switched allegiance to the NDA, with Rao proclaiming that his party had been stabbed in the back by Congress after giving them oxygen in the 2004 elections.[6] TRS lost 16 of its 26 seats in the Assembly, falling to fourth place with less than 4% of the statewide Assembly vote; and lost three of its five seats in the Lok Sabha, dropping to 6.14% of the LS vote.
On June 19, 2009, Mr.Rao submitted his resignation to the party General Secretary Mr.Sirikonda MadhuSudhana Chary and was away from party for a short period of time after personal attacks made against him by dissident TRS leaders in wake of the party's electoral defeat.[7]

Telangana Rashtra Samithi's main aim is to separate Telangana region from Andhra Pradesh and to regain regional autonomy as it existed before the formation of Andhra Pradesh state in 1956. K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu and formed the TRS in 2001 at Hyderabad.[1] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[citation needed]).
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Congress (I) and won 26 state assembly seats. The party also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state.

Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members. [2]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.'

TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.
On January 31, 2009, it was announced that TRS officially joined the ""Grand Alliance"" headed by Telugu Desam Party and including the Third Front and various left parties, in upcoming Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. At the same time, it was announced that the Talli Telangana, led by actress Vijayshanti, had merged into the TRS.[5] However, after the elections in Andhra Pradesh were completed, but before the counting of votes, TRS switched allegiance to the NDA, with Rao proclaiming that his party had been stabbed in the back by Congress after giving them oxygen in the 2005 elections.[6] TRS lost 16 of its 26 seats in the Assembly, falling to fourth place with less than 4% of the statewide Assembly vote; and lost three of its five seats in the Lok Sabha, dropping to 6.14% of the LS vote.
On June 19, 2009, Mr.Rao submitted his resignation to the party General Secretary Mr.Sirikonda MadhuSudhana Chary and was away from party for a short period of time after personal attacks made against him by dissident TRS leaders in wake of the party's electoral defeat.[7]

At the same time, it was announced that the Talli Telangana, led by actress Vijayshanti, had merged into the TRS.[5] However, after the elections in Andhra Pradesh were completed, but before the counting of votes, TRS switched allegiance to the NDA, with Rao proclaiming that his party had been stabbed in the back by Congress after giving them oxygen in the 2005 elections.[6] TRS lost 16 of its 26 seats in the Assembly, falling to fourth place with less than 4% of the statewide Assembly vote; and lost three of its five seats in the Lok Sabha, dropping to 6.14% of the LS vote.
On June 19, 2009, Mr.Rao submitted his resignation to the party General Secretary Mr.Sirikonda MadhuSudhana Chary and was away from party for a short period of time after personal attacks made against him by dissident TRS leaders in wake of the party's electoral defeat.[7]

Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is a regional separatist political party in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.


Telangana Rashtra Samithi's main aim is to separate Telangana region from Andhra Pradesh and to regain regional autonomy as it existed before the formation of Andhra Pradesh state in 1956. K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu and formed the TRS in 2001 at Hyderabad.[2] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[citation needed]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Congress (I) and won 26 state assembly seats. The party also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that,How can a party with a adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months ? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members. [3]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[4] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[5] In the bye-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party.

The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[4] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[5] In the bye-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.
On January 31, 2009, it was announced that TRS officially joined the ""Grand Alliance"" headed by Telugu Desam Party and including the Third Front and various left parties, in upcoming Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. At the same time, it was announced that the Talli Telangana, led by actress Vijayshanti, had merged into the TRS.[6] However, after the elections in Andhra Pradesh were completed, but before the counting of votes, TRS switched allegiance to the NDA, with Rao proclaiming that his party had been stabbed in the back by Congress after giving them oxygen in the 2005 elections.[7] TRS lost 16 of its 26 seats in the Assembly, falling to fourth place with less than 4% of the statewide Assembly vote; and lost three of its five seats in the Lok Sabha, dropping to 6.14% of the LS vote.
On June 19, 2009, Mr.Rao submitted his resignation to the party General Secretary Mr.Sirikonda MadhuSudhana Chary and was away from party for a short period of time after personal attacks made against him by dissident TRS leaders in wake of the party's electoral defeat.[8]

"2011-10-17 06:55:32","Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is a regional separatist political party in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.


Telangana Rashtra Samithi's main aim is to separate Telangana region from Andhra Pradesh and to regain regional autonomy as it existed before the formation of Andhra Pradesh state in 1956. K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu and formed the TRS in 2001 at Hyderabad.[2] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[citation needed]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Congress (I) and won 26 state assembly seats. The party also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that,How can a party with a adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months ? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members. [3]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[4] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term.

KCR has made several farcical claims over a decade in numerous public stages that, Telangana will be formed in a deadline fabricated by himself. In May 31st, 2004 in an interview to Times of India, he said that "" Some insane people are day dreaming that they will be able to stop Telangana, but it will be a reality in six months"".In response to the question that the "" Left Parties with the support of 60-odd MPs have openly said that they're against Telangana Bill"".

"2011-09-05 02:47:09","Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is a regional separatist political party in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.


Telangana Rashtra Samithi's main aim is to separate Telangana region from Andhra Pradesh and to regain regional autonomy as it existed before the formation of Andhra Pradesh state in 1956. K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), the founder and president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, was a member of the Telugu Desam Party until he quit the party due to differences with Nara Chandrababu Naidu and formed the TRS in 2001 at Hyderabad.[2] He quit the Membership of AP Legislative Assembly and the post of Deputy Speaker of AP Legislature while floating the Party. The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[citation needed]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Congress (I) and won 26 state assembly seats. The party also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On Sept 4th 2011, Wikileaks revealed some sensational cables related to the then resignation of the TRS members for the formation of a separate state. The actual grounds on which they have resigned is due to life-threat to the TRS party members from the Maoists of the Telangana region. The question that arises is that,How can a party with a adhering alliance with the Indian National Congress contest in elections and then break the bonding within a short span of 6 months ? Despite being offered several Minister posts to the TRS party members. [3]
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[4] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[5] In the bye-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.
K.ChandraSekhar Rao after forming TRS, which is a splinter group from the Telugu Desam Party, repeatedly said that "" No Body can stop the formation of Telangana"". He claimed that N.Chandrababu Naidu the then TDP president is anti-Telangana, but ironically it was KCR who lead the coup against NTR, and garnered the support of Telangana MLAS to make Nara ChandraBabu Naidu as the Chief Minister.[6]
KCR has made several farcical claims over a decade in numerous public stages that, Telangana will be formed in a deadline fabricated by himself. In May 31st, 2004 in an interview to Times of India, he said that "" Some insane people are day dreaming that they will be able to stop Telangana, but it will be a reality in six months"".In response to the question that the "" Left Parties with the support of 60-odd MPs have openly said that they're against Telangana Bill"".

The party initially won one third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.[citation needed]
In the 2004 assembly elections, the TRS formed an alliance with Congress (I) and won 26 state assembly seats. The party also won 5 parliament seats at the national level. It joined the governments at both state and central level. In September 2006 the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana, which was also put in the Common Minimum Program (CMP).
The party repeatedly assured the people of Telangana that the formation of the new state was on the cards and could happen 'any moment.' When the Central government failed to deliver Telangana, the party withdrew support from the government.[citation needed] On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from one of the Congress MLA. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority.
All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session for the 5 year term. The by-election was held on May 29, 2008.[citation needed]
In the bye-elections, 2008, TRS won 7 out of the 16 assembly segments and 2 out of the 4 loksabha segments, a significant defeat for the party. TRS Chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after he lost a number of seats in by-elections but was convinced to remain in office.
On January 31, 2009, it was announced that TRS officially joined the ""Grand Alliance"" headed by Telugu Desam Party and including the Third Front and various left parties, in upcoming Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. At the same time, it was announced that the Talli Telangana, led by actress Vijayshanti, had merged into the TRS.[2] However, after the elections in Andhra Pradesh were completed, but before the counting of votes, TRS switched allegiance to the NDA, with Rao proclaiming that his party had been stabbed in the back by Congress after giving them oxygen in the 2005 elections.[3] TRS lost 16 of its 26 seats in the Assembly, falling to fourth place with less than 4% of the statewide Assembly vote; and lost three of its five seats in the Lok Sabha, dropping to 6.14% of the LS vote.
On June 19, 2009, Rao resigned for a short period of time after personal attacks made against him by dissident TRS leaders in wake of the party's electoral defeat.[4]
