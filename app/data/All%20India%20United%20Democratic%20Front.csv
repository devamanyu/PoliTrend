Mr Badruddin Ajmal will take the lead on party policy matters.

As an opposition party the party will raise the issue of ‘good governance’ as the basic need of the state. Taking a cue from the numerous cases of corruption at all levels, the party will act as the citizens’ eye on all kinds of transactions the government is indulging in and how specific project and scheme funds are being siphoned off. The bottom line for the party is to show the “real picture” of the development the present government often talks about.

While recognizing the challenges faced by the party during the election in term of actually getting the last votes into the machines, the party will now re-organize organization structure around the grassroots workers at the booth level. The party’s General Secretary (Organisation) Dr Baharul Islam has been entrusted with the task of preparing the generation-next leadership of the party among the youths of the state.

Mr Badruddin Ajmal will take the lead on party policy matters. He said that the party will now give utmost importance to the development agenda in the state and exposing the ‘real’ state of affairs in Assam in terms of large scale corruption and mismanagement of the government funds. As an opposition party the party will raise the issue of ‘good governance’ as the basic need of the state. Taking a cue from the numerous cases of corruption at all levels, the party will act as the citizens’ eye on all kinds of transactions the government is indulging in and how specific project and scheme funds are being siphoned off. The bottom line for the party is to show the “real picture” of the development the present government often talks about.

While recognizing the challenges faced by the party during the election in term of actually getting the last votes into the machines, the party will now re-organize organization structure around the grassroots workers at the booth level. The party’s General Secretary (Organisation) Dr Baharul Islam has been entrusted with the task of preparing the generation-next leadership of the party among the youths of the state.

Mr Badruddin Ajmal will take the lead on party policy matters. He said that the party will now give utmost importance to the development agenda in the state and exposing the ‘real’ state of affairs in Assam in terms of large scale corruption and mismanagement of the government funds. As an opposition party the party will raise the issue of ‘good governance’ as the basic need of the state. Taking a cue from the numerous cases of corruption at all levels, the party will act as the citizens’ eye on all kinds of transactions the government is indulging in and how specific project and scheme funds are being siphoned off. The bottom line for the party is to show the “real picture” of the development the present government often talks about.

AIUDF (formerly known as Assam United Democratic Front or AUDF) contested 14 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal in the 2009 general elections. All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) has resolved to gear up its organizational units for the 2011 Assembly Election with renewed vigor and zeal at all levels. After the party’s Election Analysis meeting in June, 2009 followed by the party’s core committee meeting on 14th June, 2009, the party President Badruddin Ajmal has asked the senior party functionaries to take over the Mission 2011 from now in renewed spirit. The feedback received from the various party officials at the meeting were taken into considerations and the policy placed utmost importance to the three basic aspects – policy, implementation and discipline along with a systematic structure at the organizational levels.
The Party President M Badruddin Ajmal will leverage his position as an MP in the parliament to highlight the various unfinished projects, long standing demands and the mass corruption in the state. He will be the national face of the party which will be soon renamed as All India United Democratic Front. The party’s Mumbai Pradesh President Sri Tarun Rathi also took part at the three day review meetung and presented the party’s national agenda in view of the upcoming Maharashtra assembly election.
Mr Badruddin Ajmal will take the lead on party policy matters. He said that the party will now give utmost importance to the development agenda in the state and exposing the ‘real’ state of affairs in Assam in terms of large scale corruption and mismanagement of the government funds. As an opposition party the party will raise the issue of ‘good governance’ as the basic need of the state. Taking a cue from the numerous cases of corruption at all levels, the party will act as the citizens’ eye on all kinds of transactions the government is indulging in and how specific project and scheme funds are being siphoned off. The bottom line for the party is to show the “real picture” of the development the present government often talks about.
While recognizing the challenges faced by the party during the election in term of actually getting the last votes into the machines, the party will now re-organize organization structure around the grassroots workers at the booth level. The party’s General Secretary (Organisation) Dr Baharul IslamResume has been entrusted with the task of preparing the generation-next leadership of the party among the youths of the state.
