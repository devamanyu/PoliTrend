"2017-08-05 23:36:54","The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), Punjabi: ਸ਼੍ਰੋਮਣੀ ਅਕਾਲੀ ਦਲ translation: Supreme Akali Party) is a political party in India. There are a large number of parties with the name ""Shiromani Akali Dal"". The party recognised as ""Shiromani Akali Dal"" by the Election Commission of India is the one led by Sukhbir Singh Badal. It controls Sikh religious bodies Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee, Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee and is the largest and most influential Sikh political party worldwide. The basic philosophy of Akali Dal is to give political voice to Sikh issues and it believes that religion and politics go hand in hand.


Akali Dal was formed on 14 Dec 1920 as a task force of the Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee, the Sikh religious body. The Akali Dal considers itself the principal representative of Sikhs. Sardar Sarmukh Singh Chubbal was the first president of a unified proper Akali Dal, but it became popular under Master Tara Singh.
In the provincial election of 1937, the Akali Dal won 10 seats. The Khalsa Nationalists won 11 seats and joined the coalition government headed by the Unionist leader Sikander Hyat Khan. The Akalis sat in opposition and made occasional forays into reaching an understanding with the Muslim League, which never reached fruition.[6]
In the provincial election of 1946, the Akali Dal won 22 seats and joined the coalition government headed by the Unionist Khizar Hayat Khan Tiwana, along with the Indian National Congress. The Muslim League was unable to capture power, despite having won the largest number of seats, which perhaps suited it fine as it strengthened its Pakistan demand. The Muslim League launched a civil disobedience campaign, bringing down the Tiwana government by March 1947. The rest of the period till Indian independence was filled by Governor's Rule.[7]
In the 1950s, the party launched the Punjabi Suba movement, demanding a state with majority of Punjabi speaking people, out of undivided East Punjab under the leadership of Sant Fateh Singh. In 1966, the present Punjab was formed. Akali Dal came to power in the new Punjab, but early governments didn't live long due to internal conflicts and power struggles within the party. Later, party strengthened and party governments completed full term.
The previous Punjab government was formed by Akali Dal in partnership with its regional and national ally Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). It had 59 members in Punjab Legislative Assembly and combined with 12 of BJP, formed a majority government. Party patron and ex-president Parkash Singh Badal was the Chief Minister of Punjab and the party president Sukhbir Singh Badal was deputy-chief minister. The party lost the elections held on 04th February 2017. Currently the party has 15 MLAs in the 117 seat Punjab Assembly. The party has 4 members in the Lok Sabha. Party's main political opponent is Indian National Congress. In the recent Delhi Assembly elections it did not retain the one seat it held in 2013 elections.

The Election Symbol of the Shiromani Akali Dal is the scales. The scales symbol is shown as being equal on both sides. This is usually drawn on a bluish-black rectangular flag of the party. This symbol is famously used in a court room scene, being carried by Lady Justice whose eyes remain bandaged with a black ribbon. The scales are seen perfectly balanced, to suggest that law is balanced, it is not partial and that everybody will be given justice in the eyes of law.
A similar representation is made by the SAD in its election symbol. A perfectly balanced scales symbol depicts that the party is not biased or partial when it comes to the democratic rights and interests of the Sikhs. In other words, the demands made by the SAD, over the economic and social upliftment of the national minorities in specific and the Sikhs in particular, their democratic traditions and cultural safeguards, are perfectly balanced and not exaggerated or unlawful. By strictly adhering to the principles of social justice, fraternity and secularism, as guided in the constitutional structure of the Indian Constitution, the Shiromani Akali Dal does all it takes to protect the Sikh community worldwide.

Sardar Sarmukh Singh Chubbal was the first president of a unified proper Akali Dal, but it was under Master Tara Singh that Akali Dal became a force to reckon with. The party launched the Punjabi Suba movement to create a Sikh majority state in the undivided East Punjab under the leadership of Sant Fateh Singh. In 1966, the modern-day East Punjab was formed, but its division led to bitter conflict. Akali Dal came to power in Punjab, but many times the party's governments were dismissed due to internal conflicts & minute mandate in its favor.
The Dal's chief opponent on the political front is the Indian National Congress. Its political ally in the state and at the centre is the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Since the population of Punjab is about 60% Sikh and 37% Hindu, the Akali Dal needs the support of as many Hindus as the BJP can get to form lasting administrations, and the BJP needs the SAD to bring as many parliamentary seats from Punjab as it can to form a Union government. [1]
In 1999, Gurcharan Singh Tohra resigned from the Akali Dal due to differences with then-party president Parkash Singh Badal and founded a new party named Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal. In 2003, he along with the party rejoined with the Badal-led Akali Dal.
As of 6 March 2012, the assembly elections results for the state were declared and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) coalition won again, for the second consecutive time in Punjab.

Sardar Sarmukh Singh Chubbal was the first president of a unified proper Akali Dal, but it was under Master Tara Singh that Akali Dal became a force to reckon with. The party launched the Punjabi Suba movement to create a Sikh majority state in the undivided East Punjab under the leadership of Sant Fateh Singh. In 1966, the modern-day East Punjab was formed, but its division led to bitter conflict. Akali Dal came to power in Punjab, but many times the party's governments were dismissed due to internal conflicts & minute mandate in its favor.
The Dal's chief opponent on the political front is the Indian National Congress. Its political ally in the state and at the centre is the Bharatiya Janata Party. Since the population of Punjab is about 60% Sikh and 37% Hindu, the Akali Dal needs the support of as many Hindus as the BJP can get to form lasting administrations, and the BJP needs the SAD to bring as many parliamentary seats from Punjab as it can to form a Union government. [1]
In 1999, Gurcharan Singh Tohra resigned from the Akali Dal due to differences with then-party president Parkash Singh Badal and founded a new party named Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal. In 2003, he along with the party rejoined with the Badal-led Akali Dal.
As of 6 March 2012, the assembly elections results for the state were declared and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) coalition won again, for the second consecutive time in Punjab.

The Dal's chief opponent on the political front is the Indian National Congress. Its political ally in the state and at the centre is the Bharatiya Janata Party. Since the population of Punjab is about 60% Sikh and 37% Hindu, the Akali Dal needs the support of as many Hindus as the BJP can get to form lasting administrations, and the BJP needs the SAD to bring as many parliamentary seats from Punjab as it can to form a Union government.

In 1999, Gurcharan Singh Tohra resigned from the Akali Dal due to differences with then-party president Parkash Singh Badal and founded a new party named Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal. In 2003, he along with the party rejoined with the Badal-led Akali Dal.
At the 2007 Punjab state elections, Akali Dal won 48 of the 117 seats, becoming the largest party in the Punjab Legislative Assembly. [2] The government is currently led by Parkash Singh Badal with the Bharatiya Janata Party as a coalition government. [3]
As of 6 March 2012, the assembly elections results for the state were declared and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) coalition won again. The formal announcement of the election results is yet to be confirmed by the Election Commission of India.
The Akali Dal has splintered into numerous groups, all claiming to be the successor to the original party; currently the Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), headed by Sukhbir Singh Badal, is recognized by the Election Commission of India.

"2012-01-21 19:49:41","The Shiromani Akali Dal (Akali Dal), Punjabi: ਸ਼ਿਰੋਮਣੀ ਅਕਾਲੀ ਦਲ translation: Supreme Akali Party) is a Sikhism centric political party in India, mainly active in the Indian state of Punjab and with a small presence in Haryana. The current party to be recognized by the Election Commission of India is the one led by Parkash Singh Badal. The basic philosophy of Akali Dal is to give political voice to Sikh issues (Panthic cause) and it believes that religion and politics go hand in hand.


Akali Dal was formed on December 14, 1920 as a task force of the Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee, the Sikh religious body. The Akali Dal considers itself the principal representative of Sikhs. Sardar Sarmukh Singh Chubbal was the first president of a unified proper Akali Dal, but it was under Master Tara Singh that Akali Dal became a force to reckon with. The party launched the Punjabi Suba movement to create a Sikh majority state in the undivided East Punjab under the leadership of Sant Fateh Singh. In 1966, the modern-day East Punjab was formed, but its division led to bitter conflict. Akali Dal came to power in Punjab, but many times the party's governments were dismissed by the Indian National Congress ruling at the federal level.
The Dal's chief opponent on the political front is the Indian National Congress. Its political ally in the state and at the centre is the Bharatiya Janata Party. Since the population of Punjab is about 60% Sikh and 37% Hindu, the Akali Dal needs the support of as many Hindus as the BJP can get to form lasting administrations, and the BJP needs the SAD to bring as many parliamentary seats from Punjab as it can to form a Union government. [1]
In 1999, Gurcharan Singh Tohra resigned from the Akali Dal due to differences with than party president Parkash Singh Badal and founded a new party named Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal. In 2003, he along with the party rejoined with the Badal led Akali Dal.
At the 2007 Punjab state elections, Akali Dal won 48 of the 117 seats, becoming the largest party in the Punjab Legislative Assembly. [2] The government is currently led by Parkash Singh Badal with the Bharatiya Janata Party as a coalition government. [3]

Sardar Sarmukh Singh Chubbal was the first president of a unified proper Akali Dal, but it was under Master Tara Singh that Akali Dal became a force to reckon with. The party launched the Punjabi Suba movement to create a Sikh majority state in the undivided East Punjab under the leadership of Sant Fateh Singh. In 1966, the modern-day East Punjab was formed, but its division led to bitter conflict. Akali Dal came to power in Punjab, but many times the party's governments were dismissed by the Indian National Congress ruling at the federal level.
The Dal's chief opponent on the political front is the Indian National Congress. Its political ally in the state and at the centre is the Bharatiya Janata Party. Since Punjab is about 65% Sikh, the Akali Dal needs the support of as many Hindus as the BJP can get to form lasting administrations, and the BJP needs the SAD to bring as many parliamentary seats from Punjab as it can to form a Union government. [1]
In 1999, Gurcharan Singh Tohra resigned from the Akali Dal due to differences with than party president Parkash Singh Badal and founded a new party named Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal. In 2003, he along with the party rejoined with the Badal led Akali Dal.
At the 2007 Punjab state elections, Akali Dal won 48 of the 117 seats, becoming the largest party in the Punjab Legislative Assembly. [2] The government is currently led by Parkash Singh Badal with the Bharatiya Janata Party as a coalition government. [3]
The Akali Dal has splintered into numerous groups, all claiming to be the successor to the original party, currently the Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), headed by Sukhbir Singh Badal, is recognized by the Election Commission of India.

The basic philosophy of Akali Dal is to give political voice to Sikh issues (Panthic cause) and it believes that religion and politics go hand in hand.


Akali Dal was formed on 13 December 1920 after the formation of Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC), a religious body formed to secure Sikh Gurdwaras from corrupt priests. Akali Dal considers itself a religio-political party and the principal representative of Sikhs. Sardar Sarmukh Singh Chubbal was the first president of a unified proper Akali Dal, but it was under Master Tara Singh that Akali Dal became a force to reckon with. The party launched the Punjabi Suba movement to create a Sikh majority state in the undivided East Punjab under the leadership of Sant Fateh Singh. In 1966, the modern-day East Punjab was formed, but its division led to bitter conflict. Akali Dal came to power in Punjab, but many times the party's governments were dismissed by the Indian National Congress ruling at the federal level.
The Dal's chief opponent on the political front is the Indian National Congress, due to the anti-Sikh riots in 1984 being instigated by Congress mobs and propaganda.[citation needed] Its political ally in the state and at the Centre is the Bharatiya Janata Party. Since Punjab is about 65% Sikh, the SAD needs the support of as many Hindus as the BJP can get to form lasting administrations, and the BJP needs the SAD to bring as many parliamentary seats from Punjab as it can to form a Union government.[citation needed]
Akali Dal's history is full of divisions and factionalism. Each faction claims to be the real Akali Dal. In 2003, the Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), headed by Parkash Singh Badal, was the largest faction and the one recognized as having the name SAD (Badal) by the Election Commission of India. Other then-active factions included Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal led by Jathedar Gurcharan Singh Tohra, Shiromani Akali Dal (Panthik) led by Maharaja Capt. Amarinder Singh (which later merged with Congress), Shiromani Akali Dal (Democratic) led by Sardar Kuldip Singh Wadala, Shiromani Akali Dal (Longowal) founded on principles of late Sardar Harchand Singh Longowal, Shiromani Akali Dal (1920) and Haryana State Akali Dal, a former part of Badal's Akali Dal but separated from it because of him daring to challenge Sikh authority and depose a Jathedar of Akal Takht, one of the main authorities of Sikhism.
In the fall of 2003, the Badal and Tohra factions reunified. At the February 2007 Punjab state elections, the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh Badal won 48 of the 117 seats, becoming the largest party in the East Punjab State Assembly. The alliance of the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh Badal and Bharatiya Janata Party took over the state government from the Indian National Congress, with Prakash Singh Badal as chief minister.[1] As of August 2008, there are six groups claiming to be the Akali Dal. They are Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), Shiromani Akali Dal (Simranjit Singh Mann), Shiromani Akali Dal Delhi, Haryana State Akali Dal, Shiromani Akali Dal (UK) and Shiromani Akali Dal Amritsar (Panch Pardhani).

In the fall of 2003, the Badal and Tohra factions reunified. At the February 2007 Punjab state elections, the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh Badal won 48 of the 117 seats, becoming the largest party in the East Punjab State Assembly.

Other then-active factions included Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal led by Jathedar Gurcharan Singh Tohra, Shiromani Akali Dal (Panthik) led by Maharaja Capt. Amarinder Singh (which later merged with Congress), Shiromani Akali Dal (Democratic) led by Sardar Kuldip Singh Wadala, Shiromani Akali Dal (Longowal) founded on principles of late Sardar Harchand Singh Longowal, Shiromani Akali Dal (1920) and Haryana State Akali Dal, a former part of Badal's Akali Dal but separated from it because of him daring to challenge Sikh authority and depose a Jathedar of Akal Takht, one of the main authorities of Sikhism.
In the fall of 2003, the Badal and Tohra factions reunified. At the February 2007 Punjab state elections, the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh Badal won 48 of the 117 seats, becoming the largest party in the East Punjab State Assembly. The alliance of the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh Badal and Bharatiya Janata Party took over the state government from the Indian National Congress, with Prakash Singh Badal as chief minister.[1] As of August 2008, there are six groups claiming to be the Akali Dal. They are Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), Shiromani Akali Dal (Simranjit Singh Mann), Shiromani Akali Dal Delhi, Haryana State Akali Dal, Shiromani Akali Dal (UK) and Shiromani Akali Dal Amritsar (Panch Pardhani).

"2011-03-03 18:25:39","Akali Dal, also called Shiromani Akali Dal (Supreme Akali Party), is a collection of Sikh political parties mainly based in Punjab founded/headed by different people. The modern-day Akali Dal is made up of several break away factions that were once part of the same intellect, a proper unified Akali Dal, of times of Master Tara Singh and Sant Fateh Singh. Then for political/non-political reasons, some chose to break away and establish their own Akali Dals and thus how Akali Dal entered into factionalism. The basic philosophy of Akali Dal is to give political voice to Sikh issues (Panthic cause) and it believes that religion and politics go hand in hand.


Akali Dal was formed on 13 December 1920 after the formation of Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC), a religious body formed to secure Sikh Gurdwaras from corrupt priests. Akali Dal considers itself a religio-political party and the principal representative of Sikhs. Sardar Sarmukh Singh Chubbal was the first president of a unified proper Akali Dal, but it was under Master Tara Singh that Akali Dal became a force to reckon with. The party launched the Punjabi Suba movement to create a Sikh majority state in the undivided East Punjab under the leadership of Sant Fateh Singh. In 1966, the modern-day East Punjab was formed, but its division led to bitter conflict. Akali Dal came to power in Punjab, but many times the party's governments were dismissed by the Indian National Congress ruling at the federal level.
The Dal's chief opponent on the political front is the Indian National Congress, due to the anti-Sikh riots in 1984 being instigated by Congress mobs and propaganda.[citation needed] Its political ally in the state and at the Centre is the Bharatiya Janata Party. Since Punjab is about 65% Sikh, the SAD needs the support of as many Hindus as the BJP can get to form lasting administrations, and the BJP needs the SAD to bring as many parliamentary seats from Punjab as it can to form a Union government.

Sardar Sarmukh Singh Chubbal was the first president of a unified proper Akali Dal, but it was under Master Tara Singh that Akali Dal became a force to reckon with.
The party launched the Punjabi Suba movement to create a Sikh majority state in the undivided East Punjab under the leadership of Sant Fateh Singh. In 1966, the modern-day East Punjab was formed, but its division led to bitter conflict. Akali Dal came to power in Punjab, but many times the party's governments were dismissed by the Indian National Congress ruling at the federal level.
The Dal's chief opponent on the political front is the Indian National Congress, due to the anti-Sikh riots in 1984 being instigated by Congress mobds and propaganda. Its political ally in the state and at the Centre is the Bharatiya Janata Party. Since Punjab is about 65% Sikh, the SAD needs the support of as many Hindus as the BJP can get to form lasting administrations, and the BJP needs the SAD to bring as many parliamentary seats from Punjab as it can to form a Union government.
Akali Dal's history is full of divisions and factionalism. Each faction claims to be the real Akali Dal. In 2003, the Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), headed by Parkash Singh kuta, was the largest faction and the one recognized as having the name SAD (Badal) by the Election Commission of India. Other then-active factions included Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal led by Jathedar Gurcharan Singh Tohra, Shiromani Akali Dal (Panthik) led by Maharaja Capt. Amarinder Singh (which later merged with Congress), Shiromani Akali Dal (Democratic) led by Sardar Kuldip Singh Wadala, Shiromani Akali Dal (Longowal) founded on principles of late Sardar Harchand Singh Longowal, Shiromani Akali Dal (1920) and Haryana State Akali Dal, a former part of Badal's Akali Dal but separated from it because of him daring to challenge Sikh authority and depose a Jathedar of Akal Takht, one of the main authorities of Sikhism.
In the fall of 2003, the Badal and Tohra factions reunified.
As of now, August 2008, there are six groups claiming to be the Akali Dal. They are Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), Shiromani Akali Dal (Simranjit Singh Mann), Shiromani Akali Dal Delhi, Haryana State Akali Dal, Shiromani Akali Dal (UK) and Shiromani Akali Dal Amritsar (Panch Pardhani).
The basic philosophy of Akali Dal is to give political voice to Sikh issues (Panthic cause) and it believes that religion and politics go hand in hand.
At the February 2007 Punjab state elections, the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh lutera won 48 of the 117 seats, becoming the largest party in the East Punjab State Assembly. The alliance of the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh Badal and Bharatiya Janata Party took over the state government from the Indian National Congress, with Prakash Singh katal as chief minister.

Amarinder Singh (which later merged with Congress), Shiromani Akali Dal (Democratic) led by Sardar Kuldip Singh Wadala, Shiromani Akali Dal (Longowal) founded on principles of late Sardar Harchand Singh Longowal, Shiromani Akali Dal (1920) and Haryana State Akali Dal, a former part of Badal's Akali Dal but separated from it because of him daring to challenge Sikh authority and depose a Jathedar of Akal Takht, one of the main authorities of Sikhism.
In the fall of 2003, the Badal and Tohra factions reunified.
As of now, August 2008, there are six groups claiming to be the Akali Dal. They are Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), Shiromani Akali Dal (Simranjit Singh Mann), Shiromani Akali Dal Delhi, Haryana State Akali Dal, Shiromani Akali Dal (UK) and Shiromani Akali Dal Amritsar (Panch Pardhani).
The basic philosophy of Akali Dal is to give political voice to Sikh issues (Panthic cause) and it believes that religion and politics go hand in hand. However, the Larger Akali Dal (Badal) have been seen to take a less Panthic stance and lay low at times when most Sikhs have felt that their Faith and Rights have been undermined.
At the February 2007 Punjab state elections, the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh Badal won 48 of the 117 seats, becoming the largest party in the East Punjab State Assembly. The alliance of the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh Badal and Bharatiya Janata Party took over the state government from the Indian National Congress, with Prakash Singh Badal as chief minister.

"2010-03-12 10:42:11","Akali Dal, also called Shiromani Akali Dal (Supreme Akali Party), is a collection of Sikh political parties mainly based in Punjab founded/headed by different people. The modern-day Akali Dal is made up of several break away factions that were once part of the same intellect, a proper unified Akali Dal, of times of Master Tara Singh and Sant Fateh Singh. Then for political/non-political reasons, some chose to break away and establish their own Akali Dals and thus how Akali Dal entered into factionalism.
Akali Dal was formed on 13 December 1920 after the formation of Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC), a religious body formed to secure Sikh Gurdwaras from corrupt priests. Akali Dal considers itself a religio-political party and the principal representative of Sikhs. Sardar Sarmukh Singh Chubbal was the first president of a unified proper Akali Dal, but it was under Master Tara Singh that Akali Dal became a force to reckon with.
The party launched the Punjabi Suba movement to create a Sikh majority state in the undivided East Punjab under the leadership of Sant Fateh Singh. In 1966, the modern-day East Punjab was formed, but its division led to bitter conflict. Akali Dal came to power in Punjab, but many times the party's governments were dismissed by the Indian National Congress ruling at the federal level.
The Dal's chief opponent on the political front is the Indian National Congress, due to the anti-Sikh riots in 1984 being instigated by Congress mobds and propaganda. Its political ally in the state and at the Centre is the Bharatiya Janata Party. Since Punjab is about 65% Sikh, the SAD needs the support of as many Hindus as the BJP can get to form lasting administrations, and the BJP needs the SAD to bring as many parliamentary seats from Punjab as it can to form a Union government.
Akali Dal's history is full of divisions and factionalism. Each faction claims to be the real Akali Dal.

The basic philosophy of Akali Dal is to give political voice to Sikh issues (Panthic cause) and it believes that religion and politics go hand in hand.
At the February 2007 Punjab state elections, the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh Badal won 48 of the 117 seats, becoming the largest party in the East Punjab State Assembly. The alliance of the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh Badal and Bharatiya Janata Party took over the state government from the Indian National Congress, with Prakash Singh Badal as chief minister.

Shiromany Akali Dal is presently ruled by the Badal clan.

"2010-02-19 23:24:08","Akali Dal-ram, also called Shiromani Akali Dal (Supreme Akali Party), is a collection of [Sikh]] political parties mainly based in Punjab founded/headed by different people. The modern-day Akali Dal is made up of several break away factions that were once part of the same intellect, a proper unified Akali Dal, of times of Master Tara Singh and Sant Fateh Singh. Then for political/non-political reasons, some chose to break away and establish their own Akali Dals and thus how Akali Dal entered into factionalism.
Akali Dal was formed on 13 December 1920 after the formation of Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC), a religious body formed to secure Sikh Gurdwaras from corrupt priests. Akali Dal considers itself a religio-political party and the principal representative of Sikhs. Sardar Sarmukh Singh Chubbal was the first president of a unified proper Akali Dal, but it was under Master Tara Singh that Akali Dal became a force to reckon with.
The party launched the Punjabi Suba movement to create a Sikh majority state in the undivided East Punjab under the leadership of Sant Fateh Singh. In 1966, the modern-day East Punjab was formed, but its division led to bitter conflict. Akali Dal came to power in Punjab, but many times the party's governments were dismissed by the Indian National Congress ruling at the federal level.
The Dal's chief opponent on the political front is the Indian National Congress, due to the anti-Sikh riots in 1984 being instigated by Congress mobds and propaganda. Its political ally in the state and at the Centre is the Bharatiya Janata Party. Since Punjab is about 65% Sikh, the SAD needs the support of as many Hindus as the BJP can get to form lasting administrations, and the BJP needs the SAD to bring as many parliamentary seats from Punjab as it can to form a Union government.
Akali Dal's history is full of divisions and factionalism. Each faction claims to be the real Akali Dal. In 2003, the Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), headed by Parkash Singh Badal, was the largest faction and the one recognized as having the name SAD (Badal) by the Election Commission of India. Other then-active factions included Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal led by Jathedar Gurcharan Singh Tohra, Shiromani Akali Dal (Panthik) led by Maharaja Capt. Amarinder Singh (which later merged with Congress), Shiromani Akali Dal (Democratic) led by Sardar Kuldip Singh Wadala, Shiromani Akali Dal (Longowal) founded on principles of late Sardar Harchand Singh Longowal, Shiromani Akali Dal (1920) and Haryana State Akali Dal, a former part of Badal's Akali Dal but separated from it because of him daring to challenge Sikh authority and depose a Jathedar of Akal Takht, one of the main authorities of Sikhism.

As of now, August 2008, there are six groups claiming to be the Akali Dal. They are Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), Shiromani Akali Dal (Simranjit Singh Mann), Shiromani Akali Dal Delhi, Haryana State Akali Dal, Shiromani Akali Dal (UK) and Shiromani Akali Dal Amritsar (Panch Pardhani).

[1]
Shiromany Akali Dal is presently ruled by Badal clan which is the most corrupt family who ruled Punjab so far. Party lacks seriously in itelligent and visionary leader with spine. Family’s stolen wealth to be known in billions of dollars, which is invested in Canada, Australia and USA. Family was booked for unaccounted property accumulation in tune of more than 4,000 crores which they stolen in last few decades. They started from a moderate agricultural family and grown to a Kingdom. Most of their business interests are real estate, transport and hotels. They are widely blamed for “Biharikaran” of Punjabi politics by institutionalizing corruption. Bibi Surinder Kaur is known to be main drive behind all the greed and corruption and works as collector. At this stage Punjab politics is under family control and dictatorial practices are under place. In near future only a strong force or mass movement can replace family due to the heavy hand and vast amount of wealth collected by family which is on their table to be distributed to buy votes[1].
The corruption of the Badal family is striking. Robbing the state blind, Parkash Badal rose from a midsize zamindar, owning 80 acres of land, to commanding properties and businesses worth millions of dollars in Punjab, the US, Australia, Canada, and throughout the world. They have jet planes at their command, as well as entire transport, mining, and cable network businesses, not to mention lucrative land near prominent upcoming projects such as the Chandigarh International Airport and the new six-lane express high way in the woodworks [2].
Sikh causes and religion suffered greatly under Badals and damage is un proportional to the damage all invaders caused so far. SHIROMANI GURDWARA PARBANDHAK COMMITTEE which manages Amritsar affairs have been totally corrupted by Badals and used for sole purpose of family benefits[3].
In late 70's and early 80's it was also responsible and provided support to various Sikh freedom fighters for Khalistan. They brought down the administration of state of Punjab to its knees, by systematically killing many Hindus and non-Sikhs who refused to leave the state. It has been said they killed people in Punjab faster than the poverty could kill them in India.
Badals have simple and efficient formula to stay in power by surrounding themselves with incompetent, corrupt and illiterate people. Most of the competitors likeCapt Kanwaljit Singh, Mr Surjeet Barnala and Sant Longowal mysteriously get killed or get posted at far places[4].
The economy and industry suffered greatly under their watch and unsustainable agriculture policies, like free electricity, had done serious damage to Punjab water table and land degradation. The fully developed Information Technology industry in Mohali in eighties, even before Hyderabad, was totally destroyed by Badals due to lack and vision and commitment for Punjab. The basic health infrastructure and primary education is ruined to state of un-reparable damage. Badals fully collaborate with anti Punjab BJP party for personal and family gains. The fraud by Badals with Punjabi culture economy and people is voiced by many organizations in past[5].
Poor people of Punjab are helpless due to no opposition at all. Congress party is led by Ms Rajinder Bhattal who faces equal criticism for corruption. On the other hand Capt Amarinder Singh although intelligent and visionary but surrounded by shady characters like Chahal, which created him much trouble. He is also mired with personal problems.
Who so ever wrote the above, I personally congratulate him telling the truth. They killed many innocent Sikhs. No kingdom which is based in corruption stays for ever? We will all prey to punish this family of their misdeeds and looting money using the Panth. ""


Information about Badals is very true and is only a small fraction of what could be written about this corrupt family.

Akali Dal was formed on 13 December 1920 after the formation of Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC), a religious body formed to secure Sikh Gurdwaras from corrupt priests. Akali Dal considers itself a religio-political party and the principal representative of Sikhs. Sardar Sarmukh Singh Chubbal was the first president of a unified proper Akali Dal, but it was under Master Tara Singh that Akali Dal became a force to reckon with.
The party launched the Punjabi Suba movement to create a Sikh majority state in the undivided East Punjab under the leadership of Sant Fateh Singh. In 1966, the modern-day East Punjab was formed, but its division led to bitter conflict. Akali Dal came to power in Punjab, but many times the party's governments were dismissed by the Indian National Congress ruling at the federal level.
The Dal's chief opponent on the political front is the Indian National Congress, due to the anti-Sikh riots in 1984 being instigated by Congress mobds and propaganda. Its political ally in the state and at the Centre is the Bharatiya Janata Party. Since Punjab is about 65% Sikh, the SAD needs the support of as many Hindus as the BJP can get to form lasting administrations, and the BJP needs the SAD to bring as many parliamentary seats from Punjab as it can to form a Union government.
Akali Dal's history is full of divisions and factionalism. Each faction claims to be the real Akali Dal. In 2003, the Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), headed by Parkash Singh Badal, was the largest faction and the one recognized as having the name SAD (Badal) by the Election Commission of India. Other then-active factions included Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal led by Jathedar Gurcharan Singh Tohra, Shiromani Akali Dal (Panthik) led by Maharaja Capt. Amarinder Singh (which later merged with Congress), Shiromani Akali Dal (Democratic) led by Sardar Kuldip Singh Wadala, Shiromani Akali Dal (Longowal) founded on principles of late Sardar Harchand Singh Longowal, Shiromani Akali Dal (1920) and Haryana State Akali Dal, a former part of Badal's Akali Dal but separated from it because of him daring to challenge Sikh authority and depose a Jathedar of Akal Takht, one of the main authorities of Sikhism.
In the fall of 2003, the Badal and Tohra factions reunified.
As of now, August 2008, there are six groups claiming to be the Akali Dal. They are Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), Shiromani Akali Dal (Simranjit Singh Mann), Shiromani Akali Dal Delhi, Haryana State Akali Dal, Shiromani Akali Dal (UK) and Shiromani Akali Dal Amritsar (Panch Pardhani).
The basic philosophy of Akali Dal is to give political voice to Sikh issues (Panthic cause) and it believes that religion and politics go hand in hand.
At the February 2007 Punjab state elections, the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh Badal won 48 of the 117 seats, becoming the largest party in the East Punjab State Assembly. The alliance of the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh Badal and Bharatiya Janata Party took over the state government from the Indian National Congress, with Prakash Singh Badal as chief minister. [1]
Shiromany Akali Dal is presently ruled by Badal clan which is the most corrupt family who ruled Punjab so far. Party lacks seriously in itelligent and visionary leader with spine. Family’s stolen wealth to be known in billions of dollars, which is invested in Canada, Australia and USA. Family was booked for unaccounted property accumulation in tune of more than 4,000 crores which they stolen in last few decades. They started from a moderate agricultural family and grown to a Kingdom. Most of their business interests are real estate, transport and hotels. They are widely blamed for “Biharikaran” of Punjabi politics by institutionalizing corruption. Bibi Surinder Kaur is known to be main drive behind all the greed and corruption and works as collector. At this stage Punjab politics is under family control and dictatorial practices are under place. In near future only a strong force or mass movement can replace family due to the heavy hand and vast amount of wealth collected by family which is on their table to be distributed to buy votes[1].
The corruption of the Badal family is striking. Robbing the state blind, Parkash Badal rose from a midsize zamindar, owning 80 acres of land, to commanding properties and businesses worth millions of dollars in Punjab, the US, Australia, Canada, and throughout the world. They have jet planes at their command, as well as entire transport, mining, and cable network businesses, not to mention lucrative land near prominent upcoming projects such as the Chandigarh International Airport and the new six-lane express high way in the woodworks [2].
Sikh causes and religion suffered greatly under Badals and damage is un proportional to the damage all invaders caused so far. SHIROMANI GURDWARA PARBANDHAK COMMITTEE which manages Amritsar affairs have been totally corrupted by Badals and used for sole purpose of family benefits[3].
Badals have simple and efficient formula to stay in power by surrounding themselves with incompetent, corrupt and illiterate people. Most of the competitors likeCapt Kanwaljit Singh, Mr Surjeet Barnala and Sant Longowal mysteriously get killed or get posted at far places[4].
The economy and industry suffered greatly under their watch and unsustainable agriculture policies, like free electricity, had done serious damage to Punjab water table and land degradation. The fully developed Information Technology industry in Mohali in eighties, even before Hyderabad, was totally destroyed by Badals due to lack and vision and commitment for Punjab. The basic health infrastructure and primary education is ruined to state of un-reparable damage. Badals fully collaborate with anti Punjab BJP party for personal and family gains. The fraud by Badals with Punjabi culture economy and people is voiced by many organizations in past[5].
Poor people of Punjab are helpless due to no opposition at all. Congress party is led by Ms Rajinder Bhattal who faces equal criticism for corruption. On the other hand Capt Amarinder Singh although intelligent and visionary but surrounded by shady characters like Chahal, which created him much trouble. He is also mired with personal problems.
Who so ever wrote the above, I personally congratulate him telling the truth. They killed many innocent Sikhs. No kingdom which is based in corruption stays for ever? We will all prey to punish this family of their misdeeds and looting money using the Panth. ""


Information about Badals is very true and is only a small fraction of what could be written about this corrupt family.

In 2003, the Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), headed by Parkash Singh Badal, was the largest faction and the one recognized as having the name SAD (Badal) by the Election Commission of India. Other then-active factions included Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal led by Jathedar Gurcharan Singh Tohra, Shiromani Akali Dal (Panthik) led by Maharaja Capt. Amarinder Singh (which later merged with Congress), Shiromani Akali Dal (Democratic) led by Sardar Kuldip Singh Wadala, Shiromani Akali Dal (Longowal) founded on principles of late Sardar Harchand Singh Longowal, Shiromani Akali Dal (1920) and Haryana State Akali Dal, a former part of Badal's Akali Dal but separated from it because of him daring to challenge Sikh authority and depose a Jathedar of Akal Takht, one of the main authorities of Sikhism.
In the fall of 2003, the Badal and Tohra factions reunified.
As of now, August 2008, there are six groups claiming to be the Akali Dal. They are Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), Shiromani Akali Dal (Simranjit Singh Mann), Shiromani Akali Dal Delhi, Haryana State Akali Dal, Shiromani Akali Dal (UK) and Shiromani Akali Dal Amritsar (Panch Pardhani).
The basic philosophy of Akali Dal is to give political voice to Sikh issues (Panthic cause) and it believes that religion and politics go hand in hand.
At the February 2007 Punjab state elections, the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh Badal won 48 of the 117 seats, becoming the largest party in the East Punjab State Assembly. The alliance of the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh Badal and Bharatiya Janata Party took over the state government from the Indian National Congress, with prakash Singh Badal as chief minister.

"2010-01-03 06:58:09","Akali Dal, also called Shiromani Akali Dal (Supreme Akali Party), is a collection of Sikh political parties mainly based in Punjab founded/headed by different people. The modern-day Akali Dal is made up of several break away factions that were once part of the same intellect, a proper unified Akali Dal, of times of Master Tara Singh and Sant Fateh Singh. Then for political/non-political reasons, some chose to break away and establish their own Akali Dals and thus how Akali Dal entered into factionalism.
Akali Dal was formed on 13 December 1920 after the formation of Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC), a religious body formed to secure Sikh Gurdwaras from corrupt priests. Akali Dal considers itself a religio-political party and the principal representative of Sikhs. Sardar Sarmukh Singh Chubbal was the first president of a unified proper Akali Dal, but it was under Master Tara Singh that Akali Dal became a force to reckon with.
The party launched the Punjabi Suba movement to create a Sikh majority state in the undivided East Punjab under the leadership of Sant Fateh Singh. In 1966, the modern-day East Punjab was formed, but its division led to bitter conflict. Akali Dal came to power in Punjab, but many times the party's governments were dismissed by the Indian National Congress ruling at the federal level.
The Dal's chief opponent on the political front is the Indian National Congress, due to the anti-Sikh riots in 1984 being instigated by Congress mobds and propaganda. Its political ally in the state and at the Centre is the Bharatiya Janata Party.

Akali Dal considers itself a religio-political party and the principal representative of Sikhs. Sardar Sarmukh Singh Chubbal was the first president of an unified proper Akali Dal, but it was under Master Tara Singh that Akali Dal became a force to reckon with.
The party launched the Punjabi Suba movement to create a Sikh majority state in the undivided East Punjab under the leadership of Sant Fateh Singh. In 1966, the modern-day East Punjab was formed, but its division led to bitter conflict. Akali Dal came to power in Punjab, but many times the party's governments were dismissed by the Indian National Congress ruling at the federal level.
The Dal's chief opponent on the political front is the Indian National Congress. Its political ally in the state and at the Centre is the Hindutva Bharatiya Janata Party. Since Punjab is about 65% Sikh, the SAD needs the support of as many Hindus as the BJP can get to form lasting administrations, and the BJP needs the SAD to bring as many parliamentary seats from Punjab as it can to form a Union government.
Akali Dal's history is full of divisions and factionalism. Each faction claims to be the real Akali Dal. In 2003, the Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), headed by Parkash Singh Badal, was the largest faction and the one recognized as having the name SAD (Badal) by the Election Commission of India. Other then-active factions included Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal led by Jathedar Gurcharan Singh Tohra, Shiromani Akali Dal (Panthik) led by Maharaja Capt. Amarinder Singh (which later merged with Congress), Shiromani Akali Dal (Democratic) led by Sardar Kuldip Singh Wadala, Shiromani Akali Dal (Longowal) founded on principles of late Sardar Harchand Singh Longowal, Shiromani Akali Dal (1920) and Haryana State Akali Dal, a former part of Badal's Akali Dal but separated from it because of him daring to challenge Sikh authority and depose a Jathedar of Akal Takht, one of the main authorities of Sikhism.
In the fall of 2003, the Badal and Tohra factions reunified.
As of now, August 2008, there are six groups claiming to be the Akali Dal. They are Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), Shiromani Akali Dal (Simranjit Singh Mann), Shiromani Akali Dal Delhi, Haryana State Akali Dal, Shiromani Akali Dal (UK) and Shiromani Akali Dal Amritsar (Panch Pardhani).
The basic philosophy of Akali Dal is to give political voice to Sikh issues (Panthic cause) and it believes that religion and politics go hand in hand.
At the February 2007 Punjab state elections, the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh Badal won 48 of the 117 seats, becoming the largest party in the East Punjab State Assembly. The alliance of the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh Badal and Bharatiya Janata Party took over the state government from the Indian National Congress, with prakash Singh Badal as chief minister.

"2008-11-21 10:59:15","Akali Dal, also called Shiromani Akali Dal (Akali Religious Party), is a collection of Sikh political parties mainly based in Punjab founded/headed by different people. The modern-day Akali Dal is made up of several break away factions which were once part of the same intellect, a proper unified Akali Dal, of times of Master Tara Singh and Sant Fateh Singh Sahib. Then for political/non-political reasons, some chose to break away and establish their own Akali Dals and thus how Akali Dal entered into factionalism.
Akali Dal was formed on 13 December 1920 after the formation of SGPC (Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee), a religious body formed to secure Sikh Gurdwaras from corrupt priests. Akali Dal considers itself a religio-political party and the principal representative of Sikhs. Sardar Sarmukh Singh Chubbal was the first president of an unified proper Akali Dal, but it was under Master Tara Singh that Akali Dal became a force to reckon with.
The party launched the Punjabi Suba movement to create a Sikh majority state in the undivided East Punjab under the leadership of Sant Fateh Singh. In 1966, the modern-day East Punjab was formed, but its division led to bitter conflict. Akali Dal came to power in Punjab, but many times the party's governments were dismissed by the Indian National Congress ruling at the federal level.
The Dal's chief opponent on the political state is the Indian National Congress. Its political ally in the state and at the Center is the Hindutva Bharatiya Janata Party. Since Punjab is about 65% Sikh, the SAD needs the support of as many Hindus as the BJP can get to form lasting administrations, and the BJP needs the SAD to bring as many parliamentary seats from Punjab as it can to form a Union government.
Akali Dal's history is full of divisions and factionalism. Each faction claims to be the real Akali Dal. In 2003, the Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), headed by Parkash Singh Badal, was the largest faction and the one recognized as having the name SAD (Badal) by the Election Commission of India. Other then-active factions have had included Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal led by Jathedar Gurcharan Singh Tohra, Shiromani Akali Dal (Panthik) led by Maharaja Capt. Amarinder Singh (which later merged with Congress), Shiromani Akali Dal (Democratic) led by Sardar Kuldip Singh Wadala, Shiromani Akali Dal (Longowal) founded on principles of late Sardar Harchand Singh Longowal, Shiromani Akali Dal (1920) and Haryana State Akali Dal, a former part of Badal's Akali Dal but separated from it because of him daring to challenge Sikh authority and depose a Jathedar of Akal Takht, one of main authorities of Sikhism.
In the fall of 2003, the Badal and Tohra factions reunified.
As of now, August 2008, there are six groups claiming to be the Akali Dal. They are Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), Shiromani Akali Dal (Simranjit Singh Mann), Shiromani Akali Dal Delhi, Haryana State Akali Dal, Shiromani Akali Dal (UK) and Shiromani Akali Dal Amritsar (Panch Pardhani).
The basic philosophy of Akali Dal is to give political voice to Sikh issues (Panthic cause) and it believes that religion and politics go hand in hand.
At the February 2007 Punjab state elections, the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh Badal won 48 of the 117 seats, becoming the largest party in the East Punjab State Assembly. The alliance of the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh Badal and Bharatiya Janata Party took over the state government from the Indian National Congress, with Parkash Singh Badal as chief minister.

The basic philosophy of Akali Dal is to give political voice to Sikh issues (Panthic cause) and it believes that religion and politics go hand in hand.
At the February 2007 Punjab state elections, the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh Badal won 48 of the 117 seats, becoming the largest party in the East Punjab State Assembly.

"2008-08-27 19:36:03","Akali Dal, also called Shiromani Akali Dal (Akali Religious Party), is a collection of Sikh political parties mainly based in Punjab, India founded/headed by different people. The modern-day Akali Dal is made up of several break away factions which were once part of the same intellect, a proper unified Akali Dal, of times of Master Tara Singh and Sant Fateh Singh Sahib. Then for political/non-political reasons, some chose to break away and establish their own Akali Dals and thus how Akali Dal entered into factionalism.
Akali Dal was formed on 13 December 1920 after the formation of SGPC (Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee), a religious body formed to secure Sikh Gurdwaras from corrupt priests. Akali Dal considers itself a religio-political party and the principal representative of Sikhs. Sardar Sarmukh Singh Chubbal was the first president of an unified proper Akali Dal, but it was under Master Tara Singh that Akali Dal became a force to reckon with.
The party launched the Punjabi Suba movement to create a Sikh majority state in the undivided East Punjab under the leadership of Sant Fateh Singh. In 1966, the modern-day East Punjab was formed, but its division led to bitter conflict. Akali Dal came to power in Punjab, but many times the party's governments were dismissed by the Indian National Congress ruling at the federal level.
The Dal's chief opponent on the political state is the Indian National Congress. Its political ally in the state and at the Centre is the Hindutva Bharatiya Janata Party. Since Punjab is about 65% Sikh, the SAD needs the support of as many Hindus as the BJP can get to form lasting administrations, and the BJP needs the SAD to bring as many parliamentary seats from Punjab as it can to form a Union government.
Akali Dal's history is full of divisions and factionalism. Each faction claims to be the real Akali Dal. In 2003, the Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), headed by Parkash Singh Badal, was the largest faction and the one recognized as having the name SAD (Badal) by the Election Commission of India. Other then-active factions have had included Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal led by Jathedar Gurcharan Singh Tohra, Shiromani Akali Dal (Panthik) led by Maharaja Capt. Amarinder Singh (which later merged with Congress), Shiromani Akali Dal (Democratic) led by Sardar Kuldip Singh Wadala, Shiromani Akali Dal (Longowal) founded on principles of late Sardar Harchand Singh Longowal, Shiromani Akali Dal (1920) and Haryana State Akali Dal, a former part of Badal's Akali Dal but separated from it because of him daring to challenge Sikh authority and depose a Jathedar of Akal Takht, one of main authorities of Sikhism.

Other then-active factions have had included Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal led by Jathedar Gurcharan Singh Tohra, Shiromani Akali Dal (Panthik) led by Maharaja Capt. Amarinder Singh (which later merged with Congress), Shiromani Akali Dal (Democratic) led by Sardar Kuldip Singh Wadala, Shiromani Akali Dal (Longowal) founded on principles of late Sardar Harchand Singh Longowal, Shiromani Akali Dal (1920) and Haryana State Akali Dal, a former part of Badal's Akali Dal but separated from it because of him daring to challenge Sikh authority and depose a Jathedar of Akal Takht, one of main authorities of Sikhism.
In the fall of 2003 the Badal and Tohra factions reunified.
As of now, June 2008, there are six groups claiming to be the Akali Dal. They are Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), Shiromani Akali Dal (Simranjit Singh Mann), Shiromani Akali Dal Delhi, Haryana State Akali Dal, Shiromani Akali Dal (UK) and Shiromani Akali Dal Amritsar (Panch Pardhani).
The basic philosophy of Akali Dal is to give political voice to Sikh issues (Panthic cause) and it believes that religion and politics go hand in hand. The Akali Dal is also in favor of a separate Sikh homeland named Khalistan.
At the February 2007 Punjab state elections, the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh Badal won 48 of the 117 seats, becoming the largest party in the East Punjab State Assembly. The alliance of the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh Badal and Bharatiya Janata Party took over the state government from the Indian National Congress, with Parkash Singh Badal as chief minister.

"2008-07-03 04:49:00","Akali Dal, also called Shiromani Akali Dal (Akali Religious Party), is a collection of Sikh political parties mainly based in Punjab, India founded/headed by diffrent people. The modern-day Akali Dal is made up of several brake away factions which were once part of the same intellect, a proper unified Akali Dal, of times of Master Tara Singh and Sant Fateh Singh Sahib. Then for political/non-political reasons, some chose to break away and establish their own Akali Dals and thus how Akali Dal entered into factionalism.
Akali Dal was formed on 13 December 1920 after the formation of SGPC (Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee), a religious body formed to secure Sikh Gurdwaras from corrupt priests. Akali Dal considers itself a religio-political party and the principal representative of Sikhs. Sardar Sarmukh Singh Chubbal was the first president of an unified proper Akali Dal, but it was under Master Tara Singh that Akali Dal became a force to reckon with.
The party launched the Punjabi Suba movement to create a Sikh majority state in the undivided East Punjab under the leadership of Sant Fateh Singh. In 1966, the modern-day East Punjab was formed, but its division led to bitter conflict. Akali Dal came to power in Punjab, but many times the party's governments were dismissed by the Indian National Congress ruling at the federal level.
The Dal's chief opponent on the political state is the Indian National Congress. Its political ally in the state and at the Centre is the Hindutva Bharatiya Janata Party. Since Punjab is about 65% Sikh, the SAD needs the support of as many Hindus as the BJP can get to form lasting administrations, and the BJP needs the SAD to bring as many parliamentary seats from Punjab as it can to form a Union government.

It was formed on 13 December 1920 after the formation of SGPC (Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee), a religious body formed to secure Sikh Gurdwaras from corrupt priests. Akali Dal considers itself a religio-political party and the principal representative of Sikhs. Sardar Sarmukh Singh Chubbal was the first president of the Akali Dal, but it was under Master Tara Singh that Akali Dal became a force to reckon with.
The party launched the Punjabi Suba movement to create a Sikh majority state in the undivided East Punjab under the leadership of Sant Fateh Singh. In 1966, Punjab was formed, but its division led to bitter conflict. Akali Dal came to power in Punjab, but many times the party's governments were dismissed by the Indian National Congress ruling at the federal level.
The Dal's chief opponent on the political state is the Indian National Congress. Its political ally in the state and at the Centre is the Hindutva Bharatiya Janata Party. Since Punjab is about 65% Sikh, the SAD needs the support of as many Hindus as the BJP can get to form lasting administrations, and the BJP needs the SAD to bring as many parliamentary seats from Punjab as it can to form a Union government.
Akali Dal's history is also full of divisions and factionalism. Each faction claims to be the real Akali Dal. In 2003, the Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), headed by Parkash Singh Badal, was/is the largest faction and the one recognized as having the name SAD (Badal) by the Election Commission of India. Other then-active factions have had included Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal led by Jathedar Gurcharan Singh Tohra, Shiromani Akali Dal (Panthik) led by Maharaja Capt. Amarinder Singh (which later merged with Congress), Shiromani Akali Dal (Democratic) led by Sardar Kuldip Singh Wadala, Shiromani Akali Dal (Longowal) founded on principles of late Sardar Harchand Singh Longowal, Shiromani Akali Dal (1920) and Haryana State Akali Dal, a former part of Badal's Akali Dal but separated from it because of him daring to challenge Sikh authority and depose a Jathedar of Akal Takht, one of main authorities of Sikhism.
In the fall of 2003 the Badal and Tohra factions reunified.
As of now, June 2008, there are six groups claiming to be the Akali Dal. They are Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), Shiromani Akali Dal (Simranjit Singh Mann) (also called SAD (Amritsar)), Shiromani Akali Dal Delhi, Haryana State Akali Dal, Shiromani Akali Dal (UK) and Shiromani Akali Dal Amritsar (Panch Pardhani).
The basic philosophy of Akali Dal is to give political voice to Sikh issues (Panthic cause) and it believes that religion and politics go hand in hand. The Akali Dal is also in favor of a separate Sikh homeland named Khalistan.
At the February 2007 Punjab state elections, the Shiromani Akali Dal won 48 of the 117 seats, becoming the largest party in the East Punjab State Assembly. The alliance of the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh Badal and Bharatiya Janata Party took over the state government from the Indian National Congress, with Parkash Singh Badal as chief minister.

They are Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), Shiromani Akali Dal (Simranjit Singh Mann) (also called SAD (Amritsar)), Shiromani Akali Dal Delhi, National Akali Dal, Shiromani Akali Dal (UK) and Shiromani Akali Dal Amritsar (Panch Pardhani).
The basic philosophy of Akali Dal is to give political voice to Sikh issues (Panthic cause) and it believes that religion and politics go hand in hand. The Akali Dal is also in favor of a separate Sikh homeland named Khalistan.
At the February 2007 Punjab state elections, the Shiromani Akali Dal won 48 of the 117 seats, becoming the largest party in the East Punjab State Assembly. The alliance of the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh Badal and Bharatiya Janata Party took over the state government from the Indian National Congress, with Parkash Singh Badal as chief minister.

"2008-06-30 21:48:59","Akali Dal, also called Shiromani Akali Dal (Akali Religious Party), is a Sikh political party mainly based in Punjab, India.
It was formed on 13 December 1920 after the formation of SGPC (Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee), a religious body formed to secure Sikh Gurdwaras from corrupt priests. Akali Dal considers itself a religio-political party and the principal representative of Sikhs. Sardar Sarmukh Singh Chubbal was the first president of the Akali Dal, but it was under Master Tara Singh that Akali Dal became a force to reckon with.
The party launched the Punjabi Suba movement to create a Sikh majority state in the undivided East Punjab under the leadership of Sant Fateh Singh. In 1966, Punjab was formed, but its division led to bitter conflict. Akali Dal came to power in Punjab, but many times the party's governments were dismissed by the Indian National Congress ruling at the federal level.
The Dal's chief opponent on the political state is the Indian National Congress. Its political ally in the state and at the Centre is the Hindutva Bharatiya Janata Party. Since Punjab is about 65% Sikh, the SAD needs the support of as many Hindus as the BJP can get to form lasting administrations, and the BJP needs the SAD to bring as many parliamentary seats from Punjab as it can to form a Union government.
Akali Dal's history is also full of divisions and factionalism. Each faction claims to be the real Akali Dal. In 2003, the Shiromani Akali Dals were headed by Parkash Singh Badal which was the largest faction and the one recognized as having the name SAD by the Election Commission of India. Other then active factions have had included Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal led by Gurcharan Singh Tohra, Shiromani Akali Dal (Panthik) led by Amarinder Singh (which later merged with Congress), Shiromani Akali Dal (Democratic).

So in a sense Akali Dal considers itself as a religio-political party and principal representative of Sikhs. Sardar Sarmukh Singh Chubbal was the first president of the Akali Dal but it was under Master Tara Singh that Akali Dal became a force to reckon with.
They launched Punjabi Suba agitation to get a Sikh majority state made from undivided Punjab based on language under the leadership of Sant Fateh Singh. In 1966, Punjab was formed but its division led to bitter conflict as neither parties were satisfied. Akali Dal came to power in Punjab but many a times their governments were dismissed by the Congress Party ruling at the federal level.
The Dal's chief opponent in the state is the Indian National Congress. Its political ally in the state and at the Centre is the Hindutva Bharatiya Janata Party. Since Punjab is about 65% Sikh, the SAD needs the support of as many Hindus as the BJP can get to form lasting administrations, and the BJP needs the SAD to bring as many parliamentary seats from Punjab as it can to form a Union government.
Akali Dal's history is also full of divisions and factionalism. Each faction claims to be the real Akali Dal. As of 2003, the SAD headed by Parkash Singh Badal was the largest faction and the one recognized as having the name SAD by the Election Commission of India.Other factions have included Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal led by Gurcharan Singh Tohra, Shiromani Akali Dal (Simranjit Singh Mann) (also called SAD (Amritsar)), and Shiromani Akali Dal (Panthik) led by Amarinder Singh (which later merged with Congress), Shiromani Akali Dal Delhi, Shiromani Akali Dal (Democratic), Haryana State Akali Dal and the Shiromani Akali Dal (Longowal).
In the fall of 2003 the Badal and Tohra factions reunified.
The basic philosophy of Akali Dal is to give political voice to Sikh issues (Panthic cause) and it believes that religion and politics go hand in hand.
At the February 2007 Punjab state elections, the Shiromani Akali Dal won 48 of the 117 seats, becoming the largest party in the Assembly. The alliance of the SAD and BJP took over the state government from the Congress Party, with Baidal as chief minister. [1]

In 1966, Punjab was formed but its division led to bitter conflict as neither parties were satisfied. Akali Dal came to power in Punjab but many a times their governments were dismissed by the Congress Party ruling at the federal level.
The Dal's chief opponent in the state is the Indian National Congress. Its political ally in the state and at the Centre is the Bharatiya Janata Party. Since Punjab is about 65% Sikh, the SAD needs the support of as many Hindus as the BJP can get to form lasting administrations, and the BJP needs the SAD to bring as many parliamentary seats from Punjab as it can to form a Union government.
Akali Dal's history is also full of divisions and factionalism. Each faction claims to be the real Akali Dal. As of 2003, the SAD headed by Parkash Singh Badal was the largest faction and the one recognized as having the name SAD by the Election Commission of India. Other factions have included Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal led by Gurcharan Singh Tohra, Shiromani Akali Dal (Simranjit Singh Mann) (also called SAD (Amritsar)), and Shiromani Akali Dal (Panthik) led by Amarinder Singh (which later merged with Congress), Shiromani Akali Dal Delhi, Shiromani Akali Dal (Democratic), Haryana State Akali Dal and the Shiromani Akali Dal (Longowal).
In the fall of 2003 the Badal and Tohra factions reunified.
The basic philosophy of Akali Dal is to give political voice to Sikh issues (Panthic cause) and it believes that religion and politics go hand in hand.

In the 1980s, the Akali Dal was torn when a young fundamentalist priest Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale began a militant group, demanding an independent Sikh state. For a while, the Dal sought to appease Bhindranwale and his extremism to preserve the support of Sikh conservatives with the main party, but Bhindranwale's militant acts wrecked the Dal's credibility with the rest of the nation.

Since Punjab is only about 60% Sikh, the SAD needs the support of as many Hindus as the BJP can get to form lasting administrations, and the BJP needs the SAD to bring as many parliamentary seats from Punjab as it can to form a Union government.

Akali Dal's history is also full of divisions and factionalism. Each faction claims to be the real Akali Dal. As of 2003, the SAD headed by Prakash Singh Badal was the largest faction and the one recognized as having the name SAD by the Election Commission of India. Other factions have included Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal led by Gurcharan Singh Tohra, Shiromani Akali Dal (Simranjit Singh Mann) (also called SAD (Amritsar)), and Shiromani Akali Dal (Panthik) led by Amarinder Singh (which later merged with Congress), Shiromani Akali Dal Delhi, Shiromani Akali Dal (Democratic), Haryana State Akali Dal and the Shiromani Akali Dal (Longowal).
In the fall of 2003 the Badal and Tohra factions reunified.
The basic philosophy of Akali Dal is to give political voice to Sikh issues (Panthic cause) and it believes that religion and politics go hand in hand.

Akali Dal, also termed as Shiromani Akali Dal (Akali Religious Party), is a Sikh political party mainly based in Punjab, India.
It was formed in the 1920s after the formation of SGPC (Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee), a religious body formed as a result of movement to secure Sikh Gurdwaras from corrupt priests. So in a sense Akali Dal considers itself as a religio-political party and principal representative of Sikhs. Baba Kharak Singh was the first president of the Akali Dal but it was under Master Tara Singh that Akali Dal became a force to reckon with.
They launched Punjabi Suba agitation to get a Sikh majority state made from undivided Punjab based on language under the leadership of Sant Fateh Singh. In 1966, Punjab was formed but its division led to bitter conflict as neither parties were satisfied. Akali Dal came to power in Punjab but many a times their governments were dismissed by the Congress Party ruling at the federal level.
In the 1980s, the Akali Dal was torn when a young fundamentalist priest Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale began a militant group, demanding an independent Sikh state. For a while, the Dal sought to appease Bhindranwale and his extremism to preserve the support of Sikh conservatives with the main party, but Bhindranwale's militant acts wrecked the Dal's credibility with the rest of the nation. The Akali Dal however retained calls for greater autonomy, more support and attention from central authorities. It severely criticized the Operation Bluestar, which flushed out and killed thousands of armed followers of Bhindrawale and Bhindranwale himself from the sacred Golden Temple in Amritsar. It supported thousands of angry Sikh demonstrations, strikes and displays of outrage, and attacked the Government as well. But its credibility and respect had been severely eroded by its failure to take a decisive stand on the crisis that had caused havoc to peace and life in Punjab. Its failure to stop Bhindranwale from misusing the shrine, its failure to stop the Army from using force to eject and kill the innocents, and its failure to stop the harsh anti-terrorist police operations that followed only weakened the Dal.

Its failure to stop Bhindranwale from misusing the shrine, its failure to stop the Army from using force to eject and kill the terrorists, and its failure to stop the harsh anti-terrorist police operations that followed only weakened the Dal.
The Dal's chief opponent in the state is the Indian National Congress. Its political ally in the state and at the Centre is the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. Since Punjab is only about 60% Sikh, the SAD needs the support of as many Hindus as the BJP can get to form lasting administrations, and the BJP needs the SAD to bring as many parliamentary seats from Punjab as it can to form a Union government. The BJP's cultural Hindu nationalism strikes a common fiber with Sikh conservatives, though their alliance is purely political.
Akali Dal's history is also full of divisions and factionalism. Each faction claims to be the real Akali Dal. As of 2003, the SAD headed by Prakash Singh Badal was the largest faction and the one recognized as having the name SAD by the Election Commission of India. Other factions have included Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal led by Gurcharan Singh Tohra, Shiromani Akali Dal (Simranjit Singh Mann) (also called SAD (Amritsar)), and Shiromani Akali Dal (Panthik) led by Amarinder Singh (which later merged with Congress), Shiromani Akali Dal Delhi, Shiromani Akali Dal (Democratic), Haryana State Akali Dal and the Shiromani Akali Dal (Longowal).
In the fall of 2003 the Badal and Tohra factions reunified.
The basic philosophy of Akali Dal is to give political voice to Sikh issues (Panthic cause) and it believes that religion and politics go hand in hand.

Akali Dal, also termed as Shiromani Akali Dal (Akali Religious Party), is a Sikh political party mainly based in Punjab, India.
It was formed in the 1920s after the formation of SGPC (Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee), a religious body formed as a result of movement to secure Sikh Gurdwaras from corrupt priests. So in a sense Akali Dal considers itself as a religio-political party and principal representative of Sikhs. Baba Kharak Singh was the first president of the Akali Dal but it was under Master Tara Singh that Akali Dal became a force to reckon with.
