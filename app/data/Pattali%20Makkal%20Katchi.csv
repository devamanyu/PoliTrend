தமிழ்நாட்டில் எப்படியோ எல்லா கேடுகளுக்கும் முற்போக்கு முகமூடி கிடைத்து விடுகிறது. இங்கு முற்போக்கு S Ramdossசான்றிதழுக்கு ஈழ ஆதரவு என்கிற வேடம் இருந்தால் மட்டும் போதும். எவ்வளவு மோசமான சமூக விரோத சக்திகளுக்கும் இச்சான்றிதழ் கிட்டி விடும். இப்படித்தான் RSS, இ இந்து மக்கள் கட்சி போன்ற சுளுளு கும்பல்கள் கூட இங்கு பல வேளைகளில் ஈழ ஆதரவாளர்களாக, சனநாயகப் பாதுகாவலர்களாக மாறினார்கள். இப்போது இதே பாத்திரத்தை சாதிவெறி அமைப்புகள் ஆற்றுகின்றன. தங்களது சாதியின் மகிமையை (!) காக்க கொலை செய்வது எங்கள் உரிமை என்று வெளிப்படையாக பொது மேடைகளிலும், ஊடகங்களிலும் அறிவித்துவிட்டு கொலைகளை செய்தும் வருகின்றன சாதி ஆதிக்க அடையாளக்கட்சிகள். இத்தகைய வெறியாட்டத்தை வன்னிய சாதியாதிக்கத்தை நிறுவுவதற்கான பாட்டாளிமக்கள் கட்சி மட்டுமல்ல. தேவர், கவுண்டர், நாடார், உடையார் என பல ஆதிக்கத்துக்கான சாதிய இயக்கங்களும் (பேரவைகள்) இணைந்தே இதை அறிவித்தன. மதுரை மேலூரில் கடந்த ஆண்டு (2012) இதற்காக அவ்வமைப்புகள் இணைந்து மாநாடு ஒன்றை நடத்தினர். தங்களது சாதிய தூய்மைக்கு பங்கம் விளைவிக்கும் (தாழ்த்தப்பட்டோரை குறிவைத்து) எவரையும் நாங்கள் கொலை செய்வோம் என அறிவித்தன. தேவர் பாதுகாப்புப் பேரவையை சேர்ந்த கதிரவனால் கூட்டப் பட்ட இம்மாநாட்டை பாசிச சக்திகளின் கூட்டணி மாநாடு என்றே சொல்ல வேண்டும். பாசிசம் என்பது…. சாதிய – மத – நிற – இன அடையாளங்களை கொண்ட குறிப்பிட்ட பிரிவினர் தங்களது நலன் மட்டுமே தலையாயது என அறிவித்து அதை நடைமுறைப் படுத்துவது என்பது பாசிசமாகும். இவர்கள் தங்களது சமூகப் பொருளாதார – பண்பாட்டு வாழ்வுக்கும், வளர்ச்சிக்கும் மற்றப் பிரிவினர்கள் தடையாக இருப்பதாக கருதுவதோடு மற்றவர்களை தாக்கவும், அழிக்கவும் அதிகாரத்தை உருவாக்குவார்கள் அல்லது கையில் எடுத்துக் கொள்கிறார்கள். எடுத்த எடுப்பிலேயே பாசிச சக்திகள் பிறரை தாக்கத் தொடங்குவதில்லை. இவர்களின் முதல் பணி என்பது தங்களின் அடையாளம் குறித்த தற்பெருமை வரலாற்றை கற்பனையாகப் புனைவதாகும். ஆரம்பகாலத்தில் (மனிதரின் தொடக்க காலமே இவர்களில் இருந்துதான் அரம்பித்தது என்பது பொருள்) இவர்கள் மட்டுமே மண்ணின் மைந்தர்களாக இருந்ததாகவும்;;: அப்போது இவர்களின் வாழ்வு செழிப்புடன் சிறந்து விளங்கியதாகவும்: இவர்களே எல்லாவற்றையும் ஆட்சி செய்திருந்ததாகவும் அடையாள போலிப் பெருமையை புனைவர். இப்படி எல்லா நிலையிலும் சிறப்புற்று இருந்தவர்களின் வாழ்வில் வெளியில் இருந்து வந்த (இவர்களது மொழியில் வந்தேறிகள்) பிறர் புகுந்து நாசமாக்கினர் என எதிரிகளின் பாத்திரத்தை கதைகளில் கொண்டு வருவர். இவர்கள் சித்தரிக்கும் எதிரிகள் நிச்சயமாக மதிப்புடையவர்களாக இருக்கமாட்டார்கள். அவர்களுக்கு உலகின் அனைத்து இழிவான பட்டங்களும் சூட்டப்படும். இப்படி பலிகடாவாக்கப்பட்ட பிரிவினராக தங்களது அருகாமையில் வாழும் பிற பிரிவினரை அடையாளம் காட்டி வெறியேற்றப்படும். இப்பொது தாங்கள் மட்டுமே மிகச்சிறந்த நாகரீக மக்கள் எனத் தம்பட்டம் அடித்துக் கொண்டவர்கள் மிருகங்களாக மாறுவர். பிற பிரிவினரை நரவேட்டையாடுவர். இதுதான் பாசிசத்தின் வெளிப்பாடு. தமிழ்நாட்டில் சாதி அடையாள அரசியலின் பாசிசப்போக்கு நாம் ஏற்கனவே குறிப்பிட்டது போல வன்னியர், முக்குலத்தோர், கவுண்டர், நாடார், உடையார் என சில ஆதிக்க சாதிகளின் இயக்கங்கள் தாங்கள் மட்டுமே இம் மண்ணில் வாழவும், ஆளவும் தகுதியுடையோராக அறிவித்துக் கொள்கின்றன. இப்பட்டியலில் இப்போது பள்ளர் சாதி அடையாள அரசியல் இயக்கமும் இணைந்துள்ளது. இவர்கள் பள்ளர் சாதி மக்கள் முக்குலத்தோர் ஆதிக்கத்திற்கு பலியாகிக் கொண்டு இருக்கும்போது அவ்வொடுக்குமுறையைப் பற்றி பேசாமல் தங்களுக்கான ஆதிக்க அடையாள அரசியலைப் Nபுசுகின்றனர். இவர்கள்; தங்களை மள்ளர்கள் – தேவேந்திரர்கள் – அரசர்கள் என்று கூறுகின்றனர். பள்ளர் என்ற அடையாளம் தங்களை இழிவு படுத்துவதாக உள்ளதால் அவ்வடையாளத்தை மறுக்கின்றனர். மாறாக தங்களை அரசர் எனப் பொருள் படும்படியான தேவேந்திரர் மள்ளர் என அழைக்க கோருகின்றனர். சாதிய இழிவுப் பெயர்களையும், அடையாளங்களையும், எல்லா ஒடுக்கப்பட்ட மக்களும் எதிர்க்கின்றனர். அதே நேரத்தில் அவர்கள் சாதி ஒழிந்த சமத்துவ அடையாளத்தையே மாற்றாக முன்வைக்கின்றனர். இதுவே வரலாற்றில் முற்போக்கானதாகும். ஆனால் மள்ளர்களின் கோரிக்கை சாதி ஒழிந்த சமத்துவ அடையாளமல்ல. மாறாக ஆதிக்க அடையாளத்தை கோருகின்றனர். இது பிற்போக்கானதாக இருப்பதால் நாம் முரண்பட வேண்டியுள்ளது. RisePlanetApesசரி, நாம் விடயத்துக்கு வருவோம். இவ்வாதிக்க சாதி அடையாள இயக்கங்கள் தங்கள் சமூகத்துக்கான வரலாற்றைப் கற்பனையாகப் புனைகிறார்கள். இச்சாதிகள் ஒவ்வொன்றும் தம்மை சோழர்களாகவும், பாண்டியர்களாகவும் (அரசர்களாக) அறிவித்துக் கொள்கின்றன. சொல்லி வைத்தார் போல் எல்லா சாதிகளும் காசி ஆனந்தனின் கவிதையை தமதாக்கிக் கொண்டுள்ளன. ‘ஆண்டப் பரம்பரை மீண்டும் ஒரு முறை – ஆளத் துடிப்பதில் என்னக் குறை’ எனக் கேள்வி எழுப்புகின்றன. வழக்கம் போலவே ஒவ்வொரு சாதியும் நாம்தான் ஆரம்பத்தில் இம் மண்ணை ஆண்டவர்கள்: நம்மவர்கள் தான் அனைத்து தமிழ் மக்களையும், அனைத்து தமிழ் பகுதியையும் ஆண்டார்கள்: பின்னர் வந்தேறிகளால் நாம் மண்ணை இழந்தோம்: அதிகாரத்தை இழந்தோம்: அடிமைகளானோம்’ என ஆண்ட பரம்பரை வரலாற்றைக் கூறுகின்றனர். கூடவே, ‘நமது முன்னோர்களின் வாரிசுகளாகிய நம் சாதியினர் தமிழக அரசியலைக் கைப்பற்றி தமிழ்நாட்டுக்கும், சமூகத்துக்கும் அரணாக இருக்கவேண்டும்’ என்று தங்களது பரம்பரை அதிகாரத்தை கோருகின்றனர். இக்குறிப்பிட்டப் பிரிவினர் தம்மை ஆண்டப் பரம்பரையினர் எனக்கூறிக் கொள்வதால் மற்றவர்கள் அடிமைப் பரம்பரையினர் என்று உணர்த்தப்படுகிறது. இவர்கள் தங்களின் எதிரிகளாக சித்தரிக்கும் ‘வந்தேறிகள்’ எனகிற பொது அடையாளம் விஷமம் பொதிந்ததாக உள்ளது. இதை மொழி சிறுபான்மையனரில் இருந்து மத சிறுபான்மையினர் வரைக்கும் நீட்டிக்கலாம். இந்த ஆண்ட பரம்பரை எனும் அடையாள அரசியல் இயல்பிலேயே பார்ப்பனியத்தோடு பொருந்திப் போவதாகும். பார்பனியத்தின் அடிப்படையே மக்களை சாதி ரீதியாக அடையாளப் படுத்திப் பிளவுப்படுத்துவதும், சுரண்டுவதுமாகும் என்கிற வகையில் மட்டுமல்ல ஒவ்வொரு சாதியும் தமது மக்களுக்கு வெறியூட்டுவதை இலக்காக கொண்டு நடத்துகிற பண்பாட்டு அரசியல் திருவிழாக்கள் போன்றவை குறிப்பாக பார்பனிய வடிவங்கள் ஆகும். அதாவது ஆண்டபரம்பரை எனும் சாதிய அடையாள அரசியல் மக்களை சாதிவெறியேற்றப் சாதியப் பண்பாட்டு நடவடிக்கைகளில் கவனம் குவிக்கிறது. ஆண்டப் பரம்பரைப் பண்பாட்டின் நோக்கம் தம் மக்களை வீரர்கள் என்ற பேரில் மூர்க்கர்களாக்குவதாகும். அதற்காக பிற சமூகத்தோடு மோதிய தங்களது சாதிய நபர்களை கதாநாயகனாகவும், கடவுளாகவும் மாற்றுவதாகும். முக்குலத்தோருக்கு முத்துராமலிங்கம், நாடார்களுக்கு வெங்கடேசப்பண்ணையார் என காலஞ்சென்ற முரட்டு மனிதர்கள் பண்பாட்டு அடையாளங்களாக ஆக்கப்படுகின்றனர். இவர்களது பிறந்த நாட்கள் அவதார (தெய்வீகத் தன்மையுடைய) நாட்களாக கொண்டாடப் படுகின்றன இதே போல் வன்னியர்களின் சித்திரை முழுநிலவு கூடுகை முறையும் இந்துத்துவ பண்பாட்டோடு இணைந்ததாகவே உள்ளது. இக்கொண்டாட்டங்கள் அனைத்தும் இந்து மதத்தின் சாதிய அடையாளங்களை (பூசை மற்றும் வழிபாட்டு முறைகள்) அடிப்படையைக் கொண்டதாகவே உள்ளன. ஆகவே மிக எளிதாக இந்துத்துவத்திற்கு – பார்ப்பனியத்துக்கு இச்சாதி அடையாள அரசியல் சேவகம் செய்வதாக உள்ளது. ஆக ஆண்டபரம்பரை சாதி அடையாள அரசியல் இந்துத்துவ பாசிச அரசியலாக உருமாறக் கூடியதாக உள்ளது. மக்களை மூடர்களாக்கி முரடர்களாக்குவதே பாசிசத்தின் இயல்பு fascismஇதைத்தான் ஆண்ட பரம்பரை எனும் சாதி அடையாள அரசியல் பேசுவோர் செய்கின்றனர். இக்கேடு கெட்ட அரசியல் சாதிகள் தம் மக்களிடம் ‘நாமெல்லாம் சோழ அல்லது பாண்டிய அரசனின் வாரிசுகள்’ எனக்கூறுகின்றனர்.சோழனோ, பாண்டியனோ அல்லது சேரனோ எவனாயிருந்தாலும் ஒரு குடும்பத்தின் வாரிசுதான் மன்னனாக வரமுடியும். மாறாக சாதியின் வாரிசாக வரமுடியாது. ஒரு சாதியில் யார் வேண்டுமானாலும் மன்னனாக இருக்கலாம் என்கிற நிலை கிடையவே கிடையாது. ஒரு குடும்பத்தை சார்ந்த மன்னன் தனது அரசு நலன் பொருட்டு வேறொரு நாட்டு மன்னனோடுதான் திருமணம் மற்றும் குடும்ப உறவுகளை மேற்கொள்வான். அவனுக்கு சாதிக்கட்டுப்பாடு கிடையாது. ஒரு மன்னனின் சாதி சார்ந்த அனைத்து மக்களும் மன்னர் குடும்பத்தார் ஆக முடியாது. அவர்கள் தொழிலின் பொருட்டு விவசாயிகளாகவோ படையாட்களாகவோ இன்னும் வேறுவேலை செய்வோராகவோதான் இருக்கமுடியும். மிக சாதாரணமானவர்களான இக்குடிமக்கள் கடுமையாக உழைத்தும், சண்டையிட்டும் மன்னனை மகிழ்வாக வைத்திருந்தனர். அதே நேரத்தில் குடிமக்கள் கடுந்துன்பத்தையே அனுபவித்தனர். இப்படியிருக்க ஆண்டப்பரம்பரைக்கு என்னப்பொருள்? அடுத்து – ஆண்டப்பரம்பரை மீண்டும் ஒருமுறை ஆளத்துடிப்பதில் என்ன குறை? என்பது அடி முட்டாள்தனமானதாகும். அவர்கள் ஒருகாலத்தில் ஆண்டதாக கூறிக்கொள்வது நிலவுடைமை காலத்தையாகும். இப்போது நடப்பது முதலாளித்துவ காலம். சமூகம் நிலவுடைமையில் இருந்து முதலாளித்துவமாக மாறுவது என்பது ஒரு சாதியானது சமூகரீதியில் பரிணாம வளர்ச்சியடைகிறது என்பதல்ல. நிலவுடைமை காலாவதியாகிவிட்டது, அது ஒழிக்கப்பட்டு விட்டது அல்லது பின்னுக்குத் தள்ளப்பட்டுள்ளது என்றுப் பொருளாகும். ஆக நிலவுடைமை – மன்னராட்சி முறை காலாவதியாகி விட்டப் பிறகு மீண்டும் ஒருமுறை ஆளத்துடிப்பது எப்படி? முதலாளித்துவ வளர்ச்சி (மேலிருந்து திணிக்கப்பட்டதாயினும்) என்பது ஒரு குறிப்பிட்ட சாதியின் வளர்ச்சி அல்ல, பல்வேறு சமூகத்திலிருந்தும் முதலாளிகள் உருவாகிவிட்ட பிறகு ஒரு சாதி மட்டும் எப்படி ஆட்சியாளர்கள் என்கிற உரிமை கோரமுடியும்? இதற்கடுத்து ‘வந்தேறிகள் நம்மை அடிமைப்படுத்துவதற்கு முன்பு நாமெல்லாம் நிலத்தின் மீத உரிமையுடையவர்களாகவும், அதிகாரம் உடையவர்களாகவும் இருந்தோம்.’ என்பது முழு பொய். நிலத்தின் மீது அனைவருக்கும் உரிமை இருந்ததென்றால்அது புராதான பொதுவுடைமைக் காலமாகும். அப்போது அரசென்று ஒன்றில்லை. யாரும் யாருக்கும் அடிமையில்லை. ஆகவே யாருக்கும் ஆட்சி உரிமையும், அதிகாரமும் இல்லை. எல்லாம் பொதுவானதாக இருந்தது. அந்த காலத்தில் தமிழ்ச்சமூகத்தின் மீது எந்த வந்தேறிகளும் படையெடுத்து வரவில்லை. kingதமிழ் மண்ணின் மீது வந்தேறிகள் படையெடுத்தாக இவர்கள் கூறும் காலத்தில் இங்கேயும் மன்னர்கள் இருந்தார்கள். இங்கே மன்னர்கள் இருந்தார்கள் என்றால் அரசு இருந்தது. அரசு இருந்தது என்றால் அங்கு ஆட்சி செய்கிறவர்களும் -ஆளுமைக்கு உட்படுகிறவர்களும், அதிகாரம் உடையோரும் – அதிகாரம் இல்லாத அடிமைகளும் இருந்தார்கள் என்று பொருள். ஆளுமைக்கு உட்பட்டோருக்கும் அடிமைகளுக்கும் நிலத்தின் மீது உரிமை இல்லை என்பதே உண்மை. பிறகெப்படி – நாமெல்லாம் மண்ணுக்கு சொந்தக்காரர்களாக இருந்தோம் என சொல்ல முடியும்? இறுதியாக – பிறரை எல்லாம் வந்தேறியாக்கி விட்டு தாம் மட்டும் மண்ணின் மைந்தராக ஏகபோகம் கொண்டாவது வரலாற்று அயோக்கியத்தனமாகும். அரசுகள் உருவானப்பிறகு பிற நாட்டு மக்களை அடிமைகளாகக் கொண்டு வந்து தம் நாட்டை வளப்படுத்துவதும், தம்மால் ஆக்கிரமிக்கப்பட்ட நாட்டை வளப்படுத்த தம் சொந்த நாட்டு மக்களை அடிமைகளாக கொண்டு செல்வதும் இயல்பாகி விட்ட நடவடிக்கைளாகும். இதனால் குடியேற்றப்பட்ட அடிமைகள் அந்நாட்டிற்க்காகவே உழைத்து அங்கேயே மரிப்பர். அவர்களின் வாரிசுகள் அக்குடியேற்ற நாட்டுக்காக உழைத்து உழைத்து அந்நாட்டு மண்ணோடு கலந்து போவர். இப்படித்தான் நாயக்கர்கள் கொண்டுவந்த வந்த அடிமை தெலுங்கு மக்கள் இன்று இந்த மண்ணின் மைந்தர்களாகவே உள்ளனர். சோழர்களால் கொண்டு வரப்பட்ட சிங்கள அடிமைகள் கூடவே தமது பூர்வீகத்தி;ன் எந்த அடையாளமும் இல்லாமல் இம்மண்ணில் கலந்து போய்விட்டனர். ஆக இம்மண்ணின் வளர்ச்சிக்கும், வாழ்வுக்கும் உழைப்பவர் அனைவரையும் மண்ணின் மைந்தர் என பார்க்காத சாதிய அடையாள அரசியலின் மண்ணின் மைந்தர் என்பது அயோக்கியத்தனமேயாகும். ஆக சாதிய அடையாள அரசியல் இயக்கத்தவர் தம் சொந்த சாதி மக்களுக்கு அறியலுக்கு புறம்பானதையும், உண்மைக்கு மாறானதையும் சொல்லி கொடுத்து முட்டாளாக்குகின்றனர். மக்களின் அறிவைப் பறித்துக் கொண்டு தாங்கள் ஏவுகிறப் பக்கம் பாய்கிற முரடர்களாக்குகின்றனர். சாதி ஆதிக்க அடையாள பாசிச அரசியலுக்குள் ஒளிந்திருக்கும் லாப வெறி globalisationஉலகமயமாக்கலில் உள்ள அளவில்லா கொள்ளையும், அதில் ஈடுபடுகிற ஒவ்வொருவருக்கும் கிடைக்கும் பங்கும் எல்லோரையும் பிரமிக்கவைக்கிறது. இந்த கொள்ளையில் பங்குபெற துடிக்கும் ஒவ்வொருவரும் அதற்கான அதிகாரத்துக்காக வெறிபிடித்து அலைகின்றனர். இந்த கொள்ளைக்கான போட்டிஎன்பதே பாசிசத்தின் மூர்க்கத்தை தோற்றுவிக்கிறது. மக்களின் கால்களுக்கு கீழ் கொட்டிக்கிடக்கும் இயற்கை வளங்கள் முதல் காற்று,நீர் தகவல் தொழில்நுட்பம் என எல்லா வற்றையும் கொள்ளையடிக்கும் போக்கு முக்கியமானதாகும். தொட்டதெல்லாம் பணம், அள்ள அள்ளக்குறையாத பணம் இதுவே பாசிச சக்திகள் தலையெடுப்பதற்கான முக்கிய காரணமாகும். இது உலக வல்லாதிக்க சக்திகளை மட்டுமல்ல, உள்ளு10ர் வியாபாரிகளையும் கூட நாக்கைத் தொங்கவிட்டுக் கொண்டு அலைய வைத்திருக்கிறது. தலைமைச் செயலகத்திலிருந்து கிராம நிர்வாக அதிகாரி வரைக்குமான பதவிகள் பணம் கொழிக்கும் எந்திரமாக்கப்பட்டுள்ளது. பிரதமர் முதல் கவுன்சிலர்களிடம் வரை ஊழல் பணம் கோடிக்கணக்கில் கொட்டு;கிறது. ஒன்றே ஒன்றுதான் கொள்ளையடிப்பதற்கும்,கொள்ளையை நீட்டிக்க வைப்பதற்கும் கொள்ளையில் பெரும்பங்கை அபகரிப்பதற்கும் பதவி அதிகாரம் மட்டுமே அவசியம். அத்தோடு பதவியையும் அதிகாரத்தையும் வழங்குகிற மக்கள் விழிப்படைந்து கொள்ளையர்களுக்கு எதிராக கிளர்ந்தெழக்கூடாது என்பது முக்கியமாகும். இவையெல்லாவற்றுக்கும் எளிதான வழியாக மக்களை மயக்கத்தில் ஆழ்த்தும், வீண்பெருமை பேசும் அடையாள அரசியல் இருக்கிறது. இது தமிழ்நாட்டுக்கு மட்டுமேயான சாபமல்ல. உலகில் பல நாடுகளில் குறிப்பாக அய்ரோப்பியா மற்றும் அமெரிக்க நாடுகளில் கூட உள்ளது. அங்கெல்லாம் வெள்ளை நிறவெறி பாசிச இயக்கங்கள் பரவிப் பெருகுகின்றன. அவ்வியக்கத்தவர் மாற்று இனத்தவரை மதத்தவரை புழு பூச்சிகளைப் போல் சுட்டுக்கொல்கிறார்கள். இதற்காக அடையாள வெறியால், அதன் அரசியலால் கொலை வெறிப்பிடித்து திரிகிறப்போக்கு தற்போது தமிழ்நாட்டிலும் தலைத்தூக்கியுள்ளது. அது தமிழ்நாட்டில் வன்னிய சாதி ஆதிக்க அடையாள அரசியல் இயக்கமாக மட்டுமல்லாது முக்குலத்தோர், நாடார், உடையார் என பரவிக்கொண்டிருக்கிறது. சாதி அடையாள பாசிச அரசியல் பின்நவீனத்துவத்தின் இரண்டாம் பாகம் expired-poisonபின்நவீனத்துவம் என்பது வர்க்கப் போராட்டத்தில் இருந்தும், சமூக மாற்றத்தில் இருந்தும் முதலாளித்துவத்தை பாதுகாக்கிற தத்துவக் காவலன் பல்வேறு உழைக்கும் மக்களையும் சுரண்டல் என்பது தவிர்க்க முடியாமல் ஒரே அணிக்குள் (அய்கிய அணி) ஒன்று சேர்க்கிறது. இவ்வாறு சுரண்டலுக்கு ஆளாகுகிறவர்கள் ஒன்று சேர்வதால் சுரண்டுகிறவர்கள் ஒழிக்கப்படுகிறார்கள். இதனடிப்படையில் முதலாளிகளும், முதலாளித்துவ நாடுகளும் ஒழிக்கப்படுவதை 1900ங்களில் அமெரிக்க நடுங்ககிக்கொண்டே பார்த்தது. சுரண்டப்படும் மக்களின் ஒற்றுமையையும், வர்க்கப்போராட்டங்களையும் அதனை அமைப்பாக்கும் கம்யூனிசத்தையும் கண்டு முதலாளித்துவ ரவுடி அமெரிக்கா பீதியடைந்தது. மக்களின் ஒற்றுமைக்கு மாற்றாகப் பிரிவினையைத் தூண்டுகிறது தத்துவங்களையும், வியாக்கியானங்களையும் உருவாக்கும் படி அமெரிக்கா தனது அடிமை அறிவாளிகளைப் பணித்தது. அமெரிக்கா செயல்முறையில் மக்களிடையே பிரிவினைக்கான அடையாளத்தைத் திட்டமிட்டு திணித்தது. ஒரு தொழிற்சாலையில் ஒரு பொருள் முழுவதையும் (எகா.கார், உதிரிப்பாகங்கள் தயாரிப்பதிலிருந்து ஒருங்கிணைப்பது வரை) தயாரிப்பதற்கு மாறாக உதிரிப்பாகங்கள் ஒவ்வொன்றும் தனித்தனி தொழிற்சாலையில் தயாரிக்கப்பட்டது. ஒருங்கிணைப்பது தனியாக்கப்பட்டது. பெரும் நிறுவனங்களுக்கு பதில் சிறு நிறுவன முறைகள் கொண்டு வரப்பட்டது. எல்லாரும் தொழிலாளர் என்பதற்கு மாறாக தொழிற்பிரிவினை அடையாளங்கள், நிறுவன அடையாளங்கள் என வேறுபாடுகள் திணிக்கப்பட்டன. கூலி அந்தஸ்து வேறுபாடுகள் பெரிதுபடுத்தப்பட்டன. தொழிலாளர்கள் என்றால் மேலாளர், கண்காணிப்பாளர், பணியாளர் எல்லோரும் ஒன்றா? ஆண் தொழிலாளர் -பெண் தொழிலாளர் ஒன்றா? ஆண் – பெண்களுக்கு மத்தியில் திருநங்கையரும் ஒன்றா? வெள்ளையரும் – கருப்பரும் ஒன்றா? என வித்தியாச அடையாளங்கள் பூதாகாரமாக்கப்பட்டது, இவற்றுக்கெல்லாம் கோட்பாட்டு முலாம் பூசுவதற்குப் பின்நவீனத்துவம் உருவாக்கப்பட்டது. இவையெல்லாவற்றையும் உலகப்போரில் சிக்கிக்கொள்ளாத, அதே நேரத்தில் உலகப்போர் மூலம் கொள்ளை லாபமீட்டிய, கம்யூனிசத்தின் எழுச்சியும், முதலாளித்துவத்தின் வீழ்ச்சியையும் கண்டுணர முடிந்த அமெரிக்கதான் செய்தது.. அமெரிக்காதான் பின்நவீனத்துவத்தை இந்திய ஆளும்வர்க்கத்துக்கு கற்றுக்கொடுத்தது. இந்திய மாணவர்கள் மற்றும் பேராசிரியர்களுக்கு அமெரிக்க பல்கலைக்கழகத்தில் பயிற்சி அளித்தது. அவர்களைக் கொண்டு இந்தியாவிற்குள்ளும் பின்நவீனத்துவ அரசியல் அடியாட்களை உருவாக்கியது. அமெரிக்கா மற்றும் இந்திய கூட்டு அதிகார வர்க்கத்தால் பயிற்றுவிக்கப்பட்ட பின் நவீனத்துவ அடியாட்கள் மிகத் தீவிரமாகப் பணியாற்றினர். இந்தியாவில் – தமிழ்நாட்டில் மக்களைப் பிளவுப்படுத்தும் அரசியல் நடவடிக்கைகள் தீவிரமாக நடைப்பெற்றன. இவர்கள் மக்களிடம் நீடித்து வரும் சமூகத்தன்மைக்கு ஏற்ற வகையில் தங்களது பணிகளை முறைப்படுத்திக் கொண்டுள்ளனர். அதற்கேற்ற வேலைப் பிரிவினைகளை வகுத்துள்ளனர். தனித்தனி குழுக்களாக தனித்தனி அரங்குகளில் செயல்பட்டுள்ளனர் அல்லது அரசு அவர்களை தனித்தனியே தயாரித்து வேலை வாங்கியுள்ளது. தமிழ் நாட்டில் பின்நவீனத்துவத்தை 1990-களில் முன்னெடுத்த நிறப்பிரிகை இதழ் குழுவினர் சமூகப்புரட்சியின் வெடி மருந்தான ஒடுக்கப்பட்ட மக்களாகிய தலித்துகள் மற்றும் பெண்களிடையே திட்டமிட்டு வேலை செய்தனர். சாதி ஒழிப்பு, சமூக விடுதலை, வர்க்கப்போராட்டம், சமூகப்புரட்சி என வீறு கொண்டெழுந்த தலித் மக்கள் இவர்களால் காயடிக்கப்பட்டனர். இட ஒதுக்கீடு, பஞ்சமி நில கோரிக்கை என்ற சீர்த்திருத்தம் மட்டுமே இவர்களின் அரசியல் நடவடிக்கையாக்கப்பட்டது. அனைத்து மக்களின் பொது கோரிக்கைகளான நதிநீர் சிக்கல், விலைவாசி உட்பட பொருளாதாரசிக்கல், ஈழ ஆதரவு என அனைத்துப் போராட்டங்களில் இருந்தும் படிப்படியாக தலித் மக்கள் பிரிக்கப்பட்டனர். மக்கள் ஒற்றுமை பறி போனது. அதே போல சுதந்திரப் போராட்டத்திலும், தொழிற்சங்கங்களிலும், புரட்சிகர இயக்கங்களிலும் செல்வாக்கு செலுத்தியப் பெண்கள் மீதும் பின் நவீனத்துவ தாக்குதல் நடத்தப்பட்டது. பொதுவாக 1960-க்குப் பிந்தைய பரட்சிகர இயக்கங்களின் பணி என்பது கிராமப்புறங்களையே மையமாகக்கொண்டிருந்தது. கிராமங்களின் நிலவுடைமை ஒழிப்பு எனும் நடைமுறை என்பது இயல்பிலேயே ஆணாதிக்க ஒழிப்பாகத்தான் இருந்தது. கிராம பண்ணையார்கள் மற்றும் சாதியாதிக்க சக்திகளின் பெண்கள் மீதான ஒடுக்குமுறை சொல்லி தெரிவதல்ல. இங்குதான் புரட்சிகரப் பெண்கள் தங்களது தலைமையை நிறுவுவதற்கான வாய்ப்புகள் பெருகிக்கிடந்தன. புரட்சிகரப்பெண்களின் நடைமுறையும், அரசியலும், தத்துவமும் செழுமையடைந்து செல்வாக்கு செலுத்தும் வாய்ப்புகள் நிறைந்திருந்தன. இந்த சூழல்தான் அஜீதாக்களை பிரசவித்தது. ஆனால் பெண்கள் இயக்கத்தில் தமது தலைமைப் பாத்திததை நிறுவத் தவறினர். இதனை தோழர் அருந்ததிராய் பின்வருமாறு அழகாக விளக்குகிறார். பேண் முன்னணியாளர்கள் தங்களது தலைமையை நிறுவுவதற்கு மாறாக தலைமையில இருந்த ஆண்கள் மீது அதிருப்பதியுற்றனர். ஆவ்வாறு அதிருப்தியுற்ற பெண்களைக் குறிவைத்து N.பு.ழு இயக்கங்கள் செயல்பட்டன. பின்நவீனத்துவாதிகளால் முன் நிறுத்தப்பட்ட N.பு.ழு – க்கள் புரட்சிகரப் பெண்களிடையேப் புகுந்தனர். பெண்கள் இயக்க நடவடிக்கைகளுக்கு N.பு.ழு – க்கள் பெருமளவு முதலீடு செய்தனர். பணமே பெண்களுக்கான அரசியல் நடவடிக்கைகளை தீர்மானித்தது. எய்ட்ஸ், பாலியல் தொழிலாளர், குடும்ப சிக்கல்கள் போன்றவற்றோடு பெண்கள் இயக்கம் குறுக்கப்பட்டது. கிராமங்களில் இருந்து பெண் தலைவர்கள் நகரங்களுக்கு திருப்பப்பட்டனர். வீதி நாடகங்கள், அரங்க மேடைகள், கவிதைகள் என்பதோடு பெண் தலைவர்கள் செய்வதற்கு எதுவுமில்லாதவர்களாக காயடிக்கப்பட்டனர். இப்போது இப்பின்நவீனத்துவ அடியாட்களின் பணி இசுலாமியர்கள் மத்தியில் நடைப்பெறுகிறது. சமூக ஒடுக்குமுறையாலும், அரசப்பயங்கரவாதத்தாலும் நொடிப்பொழுதும் இடைவெளி இல்லாது தாக்கப்டுகிற சமூகமாக இசுலாமிய சமூகம் உள்ளது. ஆகவேதான் அவர்கள் மத்தியில் எண்ணற்ற சனநாயக இயக்கங்கள் தோன்றிக் கொண்டேயிருக்கின்றன. இவ்வியக்கங்கள் தற்போது நாடு தழுவிய அனைத்து ஒடுக்கப்பட்ட மக்களின் நடவடிக்கைகளுக்கும் ஆதரவளித்து துணை நிற்கின்றன. ஒடுக்கப்பட்ட அனைத்து மக்களின் ஒற்றமை துளிர்த்து நம்பிக்கை ஒளி வீசுகிறது. இதை தடுக்கும் பணியில் பின்நவீனத்துவ அடியாட்கள் இப்போது இறங்கியுள்ளனர். ஆக ஒடுக்கமுறைக்கு எதிராக வெடித்தெழும் சமூகப்பிரிவினரிடையே நுழைந்து அவர்களை செயலற்றவர்களாக்குவது பின்நவீனத்துவத்தின் வேலையில் ஒரு பாதியாகும். அது ஆளும்வர்க்கத்துக்கு சேவை செய்வதின் ஒரு பாகமேயாகும். இன்னொரு பாகம் என்பது சமூகத்தில் உள்ள ஆதிக்கப்பிரிவினரிடம் வேலை செய்வதாகும். இந்தியாவில் – தமிழ்நாட்டில் ஆதிக்கத்துக்கான வழிமுறையாக சாதிய அமைப்புமுறை உள்ளது. ஆகவே சமூக மாற்றம் குறித்து சிந்திப்பவர் எவராயினும் சாதிய அமைப்புமுறையை தகர்ப்பதை இலக்காக்கினர். இதில் புரட்சிகர இயக்கத்தின் பணி அறிவியல் ரீதியாக வளர்ந்திருக்கிறது. சாதிய அமைப்புமுறையை தகர்ப்பதற்கு சாதியால் பெருமையடையும் பிரிவினரிடயே கவனம் செலுத்தப்பட்டது. பெருமை பேசும் மேல்சாதி உழைக்கும் மக்களிடையே இயக்கம் தீவிரமாக வேலை செய்தது. சாதி பெருமையால் லாபம் பெறுவது உழைக்கும் மக்களல்ல, ஒவ்வொரு சாதியிலும் உள்ள சொத்துடைய அதிகாரவர்க்கம்தான் என்பது உணர்த்தப்பட்டது. ஆதிக்க சாதியில் உழைக்கும் மக்கள் தலைவர்கள் உருவானார்கள். அவர்கள் சாதி என்பது பெருமையல்ல, இழிவு என ஓங்கி முழங்கினார். உழைக்கும் மக்களைப் பிளவுப்படுத்தும் சாதியை தூக்கி எறிந்தனர். தலித் மற்றும் தலித் அல்லாதோர் ஒற்றுமையும், புரட்சிகர நடவடிக்கையும் தீவிரமடைந்தது. இவ்வாறுதான் சீனிவாசராவ், வாட்டாக்குடி இரணியன், அப்பு, பாலன், தமிழரசன் என எண்ணற்றத் தலைவர்களும், இவர்களின் இயக்கங்களும் செல்வாக்கு செலுத்தின. இவ்வாறு சாதியை இழிவென நிலை நிறுத்தும் போதுதான் உழைக்கும் மக்கள் ஒற்றுமை நிறுவப்படும் போதுதான் அதை உடைக்க வேண்டிய அவசியம் அரசுக்கு, ஆளும்வர்க்கத்துக்குப் புரிந்தது. சாதி இழிவல்ல பெருமை மிக்கதென மீண்டும் நிறுவும் கடமை அரசுக்கு வந்தது. இந்தப் பணிதான் பின்நவீனத்துவ அடையாள அரசியல் அடியாட்களுக்கு அரசு வழங்கிய இன்னொரு பாகமாகும். இந்தப் பணியை பெங்களுரு – குணா முதலானவர்கள் சிரத்தையோடு செய்துள்ளனர். இவர்கள் சாதி என்பது நம் மீது திணிக்கப்பட்ட இழிவல்ல என்றும், நம் தமிழ்ச் சமூகத்தின் மிக உன்னதமான கொடை என்றும் போலி வரலாறுகளைப் புனையத் தொடங்கினர். சாதி அடையாளம்தான் தமிழ்ச் சமூகத்தின் பெருமை மிகு அடையாளம் என கதைகளையும், சொல் விளையாட்டையும் நடத்தினர். சாதியை ஒழிக்க தோன்றியப் புரட்சிகர இயக்கங்களுக்கு மாறாக சாதியை ஏற்றுக் கொள்ளும் அடையாள அரசியல் முன் வைக்கப்பட்டது. இங்கேயும் கம்யூனிசம் இறக்குமதி தத்துவம் என்றும், நமது மண்ணுக்கானது அல்ல என்றும் பரப்புரை மேற்கொள்ளப்பட்டது. நம் தமிழ் மண்ணுக்கேற்ற தத்துவம் என்ற பெயரில் வள்ளுவம் போன்ற புதிய கோட்பாடுகள் புனையப்பட்டன. சாதி ஒழிப்பென்பது இம்மண்ணின் பெருமையை ஒழிப்பதாகும் என்றும், சாதிகளை அங்கீகரிப்பதே இம்மண்ணுக்கான இயல்பென்றும் அடையாள அரசியல் பேசப்பட்டது. தமிழ்ச்சாதிகளை ஒருங்கிணைக்க ஒவ்வொரு சாதியின் மக்கள் தொகைக்கேற்ப பிரதிநிதித்துவம் எனும் விகிதாச்சாரப் பிரதிநிதித்துவம் முன் மொழியப்பட்டது. அதாவது கட்சியில் ஆட்சியில் சாதி பலத்துக்கேற்ற விகிதாச்சாரப் பிரதிநிதித்துவம் என்பது அதன் பொருள். தலித்துகளுக்கு எந்த சாதி அடையாளமும் பெருமைக்குரியதாக இல்லை என்பதாலும், சாதி ஒழிப்பே ஒரே பெருமிதம் என்பதாலும் சாதி அடையாள அரசியல் என்பது மேல் சாதிக்களுக்கான அரசியலாக தெளிவோடு முன்னெடுத்தார்கள். ஆக மக்கள் ஒற்றுமையை சீர்குலைக்க மேல் சாதி மக்களிடையே சாதிய பெருமையெனும் திமிரை காப்பாற்றி நீடிக்க செய்கிறப் பணிதான் ஆண்டப்பரம்பரை எனும் அரசியலின் ஆரம்பம் ஆகும். இப்பணியினை பெங்களுரு – குணா மட்டுமே செய்யவில்லை. பல தமிழறிஞர்கள் இதே கருத்தை பரப்பியுள்ளனர். இத்தமிழறிஞர்களுக்குப் பின்புலமாக யுனெஸ்கோ கூரியர் அன்ட் பப்ளிகேசன் என்ற அமெரிக்க நிறுவனம் இருந்துள்ளது. இந்நிறுவனம் சோவியத் பதிப்பகத்துக்கு எதிராக (1950 முதல் 1970 வரை) தமிழ்நாட்டில் இயங்கியுள்ளது. 373 சர்வதேச NGO -க்கள், 24 பவுண்டேசன்கள் (ஃபோர்டு பவண்டேசன் உட்பட) மற்றும் உலக வங்கியின் பின்புலத்தில் உருவாகி செயல்படுவதுதான் யுனெஸ்கோ நிறுவனம். கல்வியை அறிவியலாகவும், மக்களுக்கானதாகவும் கியுபா முதலான கம்யுனிச நாடுகள் சமூக மயமாக்கின. ஆனால் யுனெஸ்கோ நிறுவனம் கல்வியை ஆளும் வர்க்கத்துக்கான அடிமைப் பணியாகவே கருதியது. யுனெஸ்கோ-வின் ஆராய்ச்சியான ‘மனிதன் முதலாளித்துவத்துக்கான தொழில் முதலீடு’ என்பதுதான் இன்றைய முதலாளித்துவத்தின் மனிதவளம் மற்றும் மேம்பாட்டுக்கானக் கொள்கையாக உள்ளது. ஆதலால் தான் மனிதவள மேம்பாட்டுத்துறை அதிகாரிகள் உழைப்பாளிகளை இயந்திரத்தை விட மோசமாக நடத்துகின்றனர். இந்த பின்புலத்திற்கான யுனெஸ்கோ கூரியர் அன்ட் பப்ளிகேசன் மூலம்தான் தமிழ்நாட்டில் ஆதிக்கசாதி மக்களிடையே ஆண்டப்பரம்பரை எனும் அடையாள அரசியலை கொண்டு செல்லும் பணி நடந்துள்ளது. இதனை பெங்களுரு – குணா முதல் பல தமிழறிஞர்கள் செய்துள்ளனர். தெ.பொ.மீனாட்சி சுந்தரம் என்பவர் யுனெஸ்கோ கூரியர் இதழ் குழுத்தலைவராக இருந்தார். க.நா.சுப்பிரமணியம், சி.சு.செல்லப்பா போன்றவர்களும் அதில் அங்கம் வகித்துள்ளனர். க.நா.சுப்பிரமணியம் தான் ஜார்ஜ் ஆர்வர் எழுதிய 1984 எனும் கம்யூனிச எதிர்ப்பு ஆங்கில நூலை தமிழில் மொழிப் பெயர்த்தார். க.நா.சு இன்னொரு கம்யூனிச எதிர்ப்பாளரான ஆர்தர் கொயிஸ்ட்லரின் நெருங்கிய நண்பராவார். இன்று ஆண்டப்பரம்பரை எனும் அடையாள அரசியலை, சாதிய தமிழ்த்தேச அரசியலைப் பேசுகிற அனைவரும் மேற்கூறிய தமிழறிஞர்களைத்தான் மேற்கோள் காட்டுகின்றனர். ஆக ஆளும்வர்க்கத்தால் – அரசால் திட்டமிட்டு பின்நவீனத்துவவாதிகள் மூலம் செய்யப்பட்ட மக்களை பிளவு படுத்தும் நடவடிக்கைகள் தான் இன்று அரசியலாக, ஆண்டப்பரம்பரை அரசியலாக, பாசிசப்போக்காக வளர்ந்து கொண்டிருக்கிறது. இந்த சாதி ஆதிக்க அடையாள பாசிச அரசியல்தான் தமிழ்நாட்டில் தற்போது சாதிவெறியாட்டங்களையும், உயிர் பலிகளையும் உருவாக்கிக்கொண்டிருக்கிறது. மிக பகிரங்கமாக அறை கூவல் விடுத்து நடத்தப்படும் சாதிவெறியாட்டங்களையும், கொலைகளையும் தடுக்க வேண்டியக் கடமை கம்யூனிஸ்டுகளுக்கே முதன்மையானது. அதற்கு பாசிச சக்திகளை தனிமைப்படுத்துவதற்கான பலமான அணி சேர்க்கையை கம்யூனிஸ்டுகள் உருவாக்க வேண்டியுள்ளது. இப்பலமான அணி சேர்க்கைக்கு முதலில் சிதறி கிடக்கும் கம்யூனிஸ்டுகள் ஒருங்கிணைய வேண்யுள்ளது. கூடவே சனநாயக சக்திகளையும் ஒருகிணைக்க வேண்யுள்ளது. ஆனால் சனநாயக சக்திகளின் நெருக்கம் தற்போது கம்யூனிஸ்டுகளோடு பெருமளவில் இல்லை. இவர்கள் முன்னெடுக்கும் ஈழ ஆதரவு, அணு உலை எதிர்ப்பு மற்றும் சமூகப்பொருளாதார நடவடிக்கைகளில் பாசிச சக்திகள் பெரும் ஆரவாரத்தோடுப் பங்கேற்கிறார்கள். இதில் பல புரட்சிகர இயக்கங்களும் பங்கு பெறுகின்றன. ஆனால் பாசிச சக்திகளின் பொருள் உதவி போன்ற நடவடிக்கைகளின் பொருட்டு சனநாயக சக்திகள் அவர்களோடுதான் நெருக்கமாக உள்ளனர். ஆகவே சனநாயக சக்திகளை சரியானப் பக்கம் அணித்திரட்ட வேண்டும் என்றால் முதலில் சிதறி கிடக்கும் கம்யூனிஸ்டுகள் ஒருங்கிணைய வேண்டும். கம்யூனிஸ்டுகளின் ஒருங்கிணைவால் வரும் தத்துவ – அரசியல் – அமைப்பு மற்றும் நடைமுறை பலமும், அதன் மூலமான மக்கள் சக்தியும்தான் இதை நிறைவேற்றும். சாதி ஆதிக்க அடையாள அரசியலான ஆண்டப்பரம்பரை அரசியலும், அதன் பாசிசமும் முறியடிக்கப்படும். இதற்கான வேலைகள் தற்போது தமிழ்நாட்டில் அக்கறையோடு முன்னெடுக்கப்படுகிறது. திருப்பூர் குணா

"2013-09-10 11:14:23","Paattali Makkal Katchi (Tamil: பாட்டாளி மக்கள் கட்சி, abbreviated PMK) is a Tamil political party.


PMK was founded by Dr. S. Ramdoss . Ramdoss had earlier worked with the Vanniyar Sangham founded by him in 1980. PMK is based amongst the Vanniyar community. PMK has advocated the bifurcation of the state of Tamil Nadu, a proposal that was seen as a casteist line as PMK is stronger in the northern half of the TN State where it commands 20% of the vote bank namely the Vanniyars.
Ahead of the 2004 election PMK joined the broad Tamil political front Democratic Progressive Alliance where also Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Indian National Congress, Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Indian Union Muslim League are members.
After the formation of PMK, and under the leadership of Ramadoss, PMK was able to obtain a significant share of power both in the regional government in Tamil Nadu and the central government, primarily due to coalition pressures and arm twisting tactics. Dr. Anbumani Ramadoss, the son of S. Ramadoss, was the member of Rajya Sabha in the government of India. Following the 2004 general election Lok Sabha elections, PMK joined United Progressive Alliance par
In June 2008, Climaxing months of bitter relationship between DMK and PMK, the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in Tamil Nadu severed its ties with the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), an outside supporter of the Karunanidhi government.[1] However, the DMK did not press for the party's removal from the UPA government at the Centre.
On 26 March 2009 PMK declared that it would join the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) led front and left the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). Following this alliance the two ministers in union cabinet Mr. A. Ramadoss and R. Velu resigned from the UPA government.

In one another instance, he sunk to a new low by saying that if PMK struck an alliance with Jayalalithaa led AIADMK, it would be like calling his mom to bed. Within six months of that announcement, he did form an alliance with AIADMK. By switching camps at the right time, PMK might have gone down in the eyes of purists, but it did gain a lot in terms of MPs and MLAs. Some of its MPs eventually became Central Ministers as well, most notable among them is Dr. Anbumani Ramadoss, who is the Union Minister for Health.

"2011-10-04 15:27:19","Paattali Makkal Katchi (பாட்டாளி மக்கள் கட்சி, abbreviated PMK) is a Tamil political party.


PMK was founded by Dr. S. Ramdoss and the state president is G. K. Mani. Ramdoss had earlier worked with the Vanniyar Sangham (Vanniyar Union) founded by him in 1980. PMK is based amongst the Other Backward Classes Vanniyakula Kshatriyas community. PMK has advocated the bifurcation of the state of Tamil Nadu, a proposal that was seen as a casteist line as PMK is stronger in the northern half of the TN State where it commands 10% of the vote bank namely the Vanniyars.
Ahead of the 2004 election PMK joined the broad Tamil political front Democratic Progressive Alliance where also Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Indian National Congress, Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Indian Union Muslim League are members.
After the formation of PMK, and under the leadership of Ramadoss, PMK was able to obtain a significant share of power both in the regional government in Tamilnadu and the central government, primarily due to coalition pressures and arm twisting tactics. Dr. Anbumani Ramadoss, the son of S. Ramadoss, was the member of Rajya Sabha in the government of India. Following the 2004 general election Lok Sabha elections, PMK joined United Progressive Alliance party.
The PMK Ministers contributed to the improvement of Railway network in Tamilnadu after Independence. The contribution of Dr. Anbumani as the Health Minister, lead to eradication of Tobacco consumption in public areas in India, availability of Life saving drugs at cheaper cost all over India, improvement of Primary Health services in India, including 108 Ambulance Service. PMK contributed for the reservation for OBCs in Higher educational Institutions like IITs, IIMs, AIMS etc.. because their vote bank i.e the vanniyars belong to the OBC. PMK is also fighting for preserving traditional Agriculture to protect the environment, Food Health, Nutrition etc.. PMK is fighting for removal of Alcohol sale in TAMIL NADU. But for the major social causes like the alcohol and and at least posturing for preserving traditional Agriculture.
In June 2008, Climaxing months of bitter relationship between DMK and PMK, the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in Tamil Nadu severed its ties with the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), an outside supporter of the Karunanidhi government [1]. However, the DMK did not press for the party's removal from the UPA government at the Centre.
On 26 March 2009 PMK declared that it would join the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) led front and left the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). Following this alliance the two ministers in union cabinet Mr. A. Ramadoss and R. Velu resigned from the UPA government.

PMK was founded by Dr. S. Ramdoss and the state president is G. K. Mani. Ramdoss had earlier worked with the Vanniyar Sangham Vimalraj (Vanniyar Union) founded by him in 1980. PMK is based amongst the Other Backward Classes Vanniyakula Kshatriyas community. PMK has advocated the bifurcation of the state of Tamil Nadu, a proposal that was seen as a casteist line as PMK is stronger in the northern half of the TN State where it commands 10% of the vote bank namely the Vanniyars.
Ahead of the 2004 election PMK joined the broad Tamil political front Democratic Progressive Alliance where also Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Indian National Congress, Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Indian Union Muslim League are members.
After the formation of PMK, and under the leadership of Ramadoss, PMK was able to obtain a significant share of power both in the regional government in Tamilnadu and the central government, primarily due to coalition pressures and arm twisting tactics. Dr. Anbumani Ramadoss, the son of S. Ramadoss, was the member of Rajya Sabha in the government of India. Following the 2004 general election Lok Sabha elections, PMK joined United Progressive Alliance party.
The PMK Ministers contributed to the improvement of Railway network in Tamilnadu after Independence. The contribution of Dr. Anbumani as the Health Minister, lead to eradication of Tobacco consumption in public areas in India, availability of Life saving drugs at cheaper cost all over India, improvement of Primary Health services in India, including 108 Ambulance Service. PMK contributed for the reservation for OBCs in Higher educational Institutions like IITs, IIMs, AIMS etc.. because their vote bank i.e the vanniyars belong to the OBC. PMK is also fighting for preserving traditional Agriculture to protect the environment, Food Health, Nutrition etc.. PMK is fighting for removal of Alcohol sale in TAMIL NADU. But for the major social causes like the alcohol and and at least posturing for preserving traditional Agriculture.
In June 2008, Climaxing months of bitter relationship between DMK and PMK, the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in Tamil Nadu severed its ties with the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), an outside supporter of the Karunanidhi government [1]. However, the DMK did not press for the party's removal from the UPA government at the Centre.
On 26 March 2009 PMK declared that it would join the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) led front and left theUnited Progressive Alliance (UPA). Following this alliance the two ministers in union cabinet Mr. A. Ramadoss and R. Velu resigned from the UPA government. On 28 March 2009 they submitted the resignation to prime minister Dr. Manmohan Singh and suffered a complete wipe out because of their constant shifting of alliances between the two dravidian parties.

PMK was founded by Dr. S. Ramdoss and the state president is G. K. Mani. Ramdoss had earlier worked with the Vanniyar Sangham (Vanniyar Union) founded by him in 1980. PMK is based amongst the Other Backward ClassesVanniyakula Kshatriyas community. PMK has advocated the bifurcation of the state of Tamil Nadu, a proposal that was seen as a casteist line as PMK is stronger in the northern half of the TN State where it commands 10% of the vote bank namely the Vanniyars.
Ahead of the 2004 election PMK joined the broad Tamil political front Democratic Progressive Alliance where also Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Indian National Congress, Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Indian Union Muslim League are members.
After the formation of PMK, and under the leadership of Ramadoss, PMK was able to obtain a significant share of power both in the regional government in Tamilnadu and the central government, primarily due to coalition pressures and arm twisting tactics. Dr. Anbumani Ramadoss, the son of S. Ramadoss, was the member of Rajya Sabha in the government of India. Following the 2004 general election Lok Sabha elections, PMK joined United Progressive Alliance party.
The PMK Ministers contributed to the improvement of Railway network in Tamilnadu after Independence. The contribution of Dr. Anbumani as the Health Minister, lead to eradication of Tobacco consumption in public areas in India, availability of Life saving drugs at cheaper cost all over India, improvement of Primary Health services in India, including 108 Ambulance Service. PMK contributed for the reservation for OBCs in Higher educational Institutions like IITs, IIMs, AIMS etc.. because their vote bank i.e the vanniyars belong to the OBC. PMK is also fighting for preserving traditional Agriculture to protect the environment, Food Health, Nutrition etc.. PMK is fighting for removal of Alcohol sale in TAMIL NADU. But for the major social causes like the alcohol and and at least posturing for preserving traditional Agriculture, the party is overwhelmingly castiest and revisionary party being an example of unscrupulous oppurtunitistic political party mindful of the interest of self, family, village and caste, in that order and not beyond it. The party does not have any agenda for the welfare of the State or the Nation.
In June 2008, the PMK opted out of the DMK-led Tamil Nadu government because the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) offered them more money.
On 26 March 2009 PMK declared that it would join the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) led front and left theUnited Progressive Alliance (UPA). Following this alliance the two ministers in union cabinet Mr. A. Ramadoss and R. Velu resigned from the UPA government. On 28 March 2009 they submitted the resignation to prime minister Dr. Manmohan Singh and suffered a complete wipe out because of their constant shifting of alliances between the two dravidian parties.

PMK has advocated the bifurcation of the state of Tamil Nadu, a proposal that was seen as a casteist line as PMK is stronger in the northern half of the TN State where it commands 10% of the vote bank namely the Vanniyars.
Ahead of the 2004 election PMK joined the broad Tamil political front Democratic Progressive Alliance where also Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Indian National Congress, Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Indian Union Muslim League are members.
After the formation of PMK, and under the leadership of Ramadoss, PMK was able to obtain a significant share of power both in the regional government in Tamilnadu and the central government, primarily due to coalition pressures and arm twisting tactics. Dr. Anbumani Ramadoss, the son of S. Ramadoss, was the member of Rajya Sabha in the government of India. Following the 2004 general election Lok Sabha elections, PMK joined United Progressive Alliance party.
The PMK Ministers contributed to the improvement of Railway network in Tamilnadu after Independence. The contribution of Dr. Anbumani as the Health Minister, lead to eradication of Tobacco consumption in public areas in India, availability of Life saving drugs at cheaper cost all over India, improvement of Primary Health services in India, including 108 Ambulance Service. PMK contributed for the reservation for OBCs in Higher educational Institutions like IITs, IIMs, AIMS etc.. because their vote bank i.e the vanniyars belong to the OBC. PMK is also fighting for preserving traditional Agriculture to protect the environment, Food Health, Nutrition etc.. PMK is fighting for removal of Alcohol sale in TAMIL NADU. But for the major social causes like the alcohol and and at least posturing for preserving traditional Agriculture, the party is overwhelmingly castiest and revisionary party being an example of unscrupulous oppurtunitistic political party mindful of the interest of self, family, village and caste, in that order and not beyond it. The party does not have any agenda for the welfare of the State or the Nation.
In June 2008, the PMK opted out of the DMK-led Tamil Nadu government because the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) offered them more money.
On 26 March 2009 PMK declared that it would join the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) led front and left theUnited Progressive Alliance (UPA). Following this alliance the two ministers in union cabinet Mr. A. Ramadoss and R. Velu resigned from the UPA government. On 28 March 2009 they submitted the resignation to prime minister Dr. Manmohan Singh and suffered a complete wipe out because of their constant shifting of alliances between the two dravidian parties.

"2010-08-22 06:20:19","Pattali Makkal Katchi (பாட்டாளி மக்கள் கட்சி, abbreviated PMK) is a Tamil political party.


PMK was founded by Dr. S. Ramdossu and the state president is G. K. Mani. Ramdoss had earlier worked with the Vanniyar Sangham (Vanniyar Union) founded by him in 1980. PMK is based amongst the Vanniar caste, an Other Backward Classes community. PMK has advocated the bifurcation of the state of Tamil Nadu, a proposal that was seen as a casteist line.

After the 2004 Lok Sabha elections PMK joined United Progressive Alliance. This party is famous for jumping alliances during election time purely for the party's/leader's personal benefits rather than people's interest (classic example is, party leader Ramadoss son Anbumani was not given MP seat during ADMK rule so he jumped to DMK & Congress alliance and got the MP seat and the health minister cabinet position also. PMK party also contributed to Global Warming by cutting the 100s of thousands of trees during early stages of politics.

PMK is strongly favouring caste-based reservations in education and jobs, which, as its critics argue, expose the party's indifference to the danger inherent in its ideology, to the principle of strong and viable states to make a powerful Federation of India. The casteist thinking, it needs to be pointed out, derives a sort of approval as it is shared by some other parties in Tamilnadu and elsewhere in India. It is resented on the ground that the talk of Brahmin, Aryan, or Upper caste domination in the Indian society, will in due course stand badly exposed. A powerful India can only become a reality on the basis of inclusiveness of all sections of people, but only on the basis of individuals' performance, regardless of their caste labels, being maximized for the optimal benefit of the Indian society. Thus the critics fear that the widespread fashion of pro-casteism in India, when castes as a whole are sought to be done away with as a legal entity, smacks of the mischief being done by parties, like the PMK, in order to garner sectional power to the detriment of a powerful India.
