Chief Minister N. Rangasamy announced that R. Radhakrishnan, former Speaker of Puducherry Assembly, would be the AINRC candidate for the Puducherry constituency.[2] The candidate won the lone Lok Sabha seat.
On 21 April 2015, MLA M. V. Ramachandra quit the AINRC, along with 20 lawyers, leaving the party with 14 members.[3]
However, on 18 May, it was announced that INC MLA Malladi Krishna Rao is likely to quit the INC by the end of the month and formalize his association with the AINRC.[4] This would give the AINRC 15 seats once again. Lack of recognition, the alleged failure of Rangasamy to fulfill the aspirations of Peravai's people and Rao's closeness to Rangaswany have been cited as the reasons for the lawyers quitting.
